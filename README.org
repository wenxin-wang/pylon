This repository helps me get into some previously recorded working state.
Working states consist of knowledge, goal and current direction. Therefore this
repository not only consists of "How"s (code), but also "Why"s (notes,
handbooks) and references (reading materials).

* Waypoints

[[./bootstrap]] contains code and instructions on how to reproduce the working environment.

[[./museum]] contains things that belongs to the past.

[[./journals]] is where I record thought process of "working" itself.

Highlights of newly acquired knowledges are kept in [[today-i-learnt]]. They should
be further sorted into topics that I am interested in, and then filed into
[[today-i-learnt/{year}]] for archiving purpose. They do not go into [[museum]] because I
think they should be fun to reread.

[[./library]] is where I record references.

* Why?

By making it easier for me to record and reproduce working states, I gain many
benefits.

First and foremost, it helps relieving the fear of losing them. I've been using
a single computer for personal work and entertainment, and even though I do
backup the data occassionally, I didn't have a way to backup my process of
working with the system and the data. Time and time again I rediscovered things
that I once knew, and valuable documents that I marked for later; and things I
recorded are sometimes confusing, because I couldn't understand the reason any
more. The thing I fear the most is that I forget how to do backup and restore
the backups, which is already happening.

Secondly, it helps me focus. When working on one topic, I often drift away into
other interesting ones. The discoveries are good, but the fear of forgetting the
discoveries causes anxiety, and forces me to allocate precious working memory
for these off-topic stuff, breaking my thought process.

Thirdly, it helps me to make connections. By laying all the materials together,
I can find and compare things more easily. I can also use knowledge learnt from
my job in personal works, and vice versa.

All of these would help me make progress, which in turns sooths me. I want to
achieve sense of ease by doing things at ease.

* How?

The key is "explanation": why things work this way, why do I have this goal, and
how did I reach here. A good explanation would make another person resonnate
with me after logical thinking, if we agree on the preconditions.
