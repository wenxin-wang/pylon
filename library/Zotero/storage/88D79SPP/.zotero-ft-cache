In The Great Escape, published in 2013, one of us told a positive story about human progress over the last two hundred and fifty years. The story there was one of previously unimaginable material progress, a decline in poverty and deprivation, and extensions in the length of human life. The generation and application of useful knowledge made this progress possible. A star of the show was capitalism, which freed millions from dire poverty, supported by the positive forces of globalization. Democracy spread around the planet, allowing more and more people to participate in shaping their communities and societies.
This book is much less upbeat. It documents despair and death, it critiques aspects of capitalism, and it questions how globalization and technical change are working in America today. Yet we remain optimistic. We believe in capitalism, and we continue to believe that globalization and technical change can be managed to the general benefit. Capitalism does not have to work as it does in America today. It does not need to be abolished, but it should be redirected to work in the public interest. Free market competition can do many things, but there are also many areas where it cannot work well, including in the provision of healthcare, the exorbitant cost of which is doing immense harm to the health and wellbeing of America. If governments are unwilling to ­exercise compulsion over health insurance and to take the power to control costs—as other rich countries have done—tragedies are inevitable. Deaths of despair have much to do with the failure—the unique failure—­of America to learn this lesson.
There have been previous periods when capitalism failed most people, as the Industrial Revolution got under way at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and again after the Great Depression. But the beast

was tamed, not slain, and it brought the great benefits laid out in The Great Escape. If we can get the policies right, we can ensure that what is happening today is not a prelude to another great disaster but rather a temporary setback from which we can return to rising prosperity and better health. We hope this book, while not as heartening as The Great Escape, will help put us back on track to make the progress in this century that we have generally made in the past. The future of capitalism should be a future of hope and not of despair.

We have written the book so that it can be read without consulting the notes at the end or, for our audio listeners, without looking at the figures. The text is self-contained and the figures are described in sufficient detail to make the argument comprehensible without them. We use endnotes for two purposes. The vast majority are citations that provide data for or document the point we are making. In a few cases, endnotes are used to expand on more technical material that academic readers might wish to check. They are not necessary to our story.
Our account of despair was often distressing to write, and it will be distressing to some readers. For people who are suffering from the depression or addictions that we describe, there is help available. If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK). You can find a list of additional resources at SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources. If you, someone in your family, or someone you know is suffering from addiction to drugs or alcohol, talking to a trusted family doctor or spiritual adviser is a good first step. We also recommend Alcoholics Anonymous (aa.org) and AlAnon (al-anon.org), the latter of which works with family members of those affected. These organizations have meetings in most places in the US and around the world, providing help for many as well as an effective support community that is welcoming and that presents no risk. Their websites are set up to help find local groups.

Deaths of Despair and the ­F u t u r e of C a pi ta l ism

Introduction
de at h i n t h e a f t e r ­no on
this book was born in a cabin in Montana in the summer of 2014. We spend August each year in the hamlet of  Varney Bridge on the Madison River, overlooking the mountains of the Madison Range. We had promised to investigate the link between happiness and suicide, ­whether it was true that unhappy places—­counties, cities, or countries where ­people report that their lives are ­going ­really badly—­are also places where suicide is more common. Over the past ten years, Madison County, Montana, has had a suicide rate that is four times that of Mercer County, New Jersey, where we spend the rest of the year. We w­ ere curious, especially ­because we ­were generally happy in Montana, and ­others ­there seemed happy too.
Along the way, we had discovered that suicide rates among middle-­ aged white Americans w­ ere rising rapidly. We found something e­ lse that puzzled us. Middle-­aged white Americans w­ ere hurting in other ways. They ­were reporting more pain and poorer overall health, not as much as older Americans—­health worsens with age, ­after all—­but the gap was closing. Health among the eld­ erly was improving while health among the middle-­aged was worsening. We knew that pain could drive ­people to suicide, so perhaps the two findings w­ ere linked?
That was the beginning. As we thought about how to write up our results, we wanted to put the suicides in context. How big a deal was suicide relative to all other deaths, and compared with the big ­causes like
1

2 I n t r oduc t ion
cancer or heart disease? We went back to the Centers for Disease Control, downloaded the numbers, and made the calculations. To our astonishment, it was not only suicide that was rising among middle-­aged whites; it was all deaths. Not by much, but death rates are supposed to fall year on year, so even a pause was news, let alone an increase.
We thought we must have hit a wrong key. Constantly falling death rates w­ ere one of the best and best-­established features of the twentieth ­century. All-­cause mortality is not supposed to increase for any large group. ­There are exceptions, such as the g­ reat influenza epidemic at the tail end of the First World War, or mortality from HIV/AIDS among young men thirty years ago. But the steady decrease in death rates, especially in m­ iddle age, had been one of the greatest (and most reliable) achievements of the twentieth ­century, driving up life expectancy at birth not only in the United States but also in other wealthy countries around the world.
What was happening? T­ here w­ ere not enough suicides to account for the turnaround in total deaths. We looked at what other ­causes might be responsible. To our surprise, “accidental poisonings” ­were a big part of the story. How could this be? W­ ere ­people somehow accidentally drinking Drano or weed killer? In our (then) innocence, we did not know that “accidental poisonings” was the category that contained drug overdoses, or that ­there was an epidemic of deaths from opioids, already well established and still rapidly spreading. Deaths from alcoholic liver disease ­were rising rapidly too, so that the fastest-­rising death rates ­were from three ­causes: suicides, drug overdoses, and alcoholic liver disease. T­ hese kinds of deaths are all self-­inflicted, quickly with a gun, more slowly and less certainly with drug addiction, and more slowly still through alcohol. We came to call them “deaths of despair,” mostly as a con­ve­nient label for the three ­causes taken together. Exactly what kind of despair, ­whether economic, social, or psychological, we did not know, and did not presume. But the label stuck, and this book is an in-­depth exploration of that despair.
The book is about ­these deaths and about the ­people who are ­dying. We document what we found then, and what we and o­ thers have found since. Other writers, in the press and in a series of fine books, have put

death in the afternoon  3
names and f­aces to the deaths and told the stories b­ ehind them. We s­ hall draw on ­these accounts too. Our own previous work was primarily focused on documenting what was happening, but h­ ere we go further and try to follow trails back to the under­lying economic and social roots.
Who is ­dying? When a person dies, a death certificate is filled out, and one of the boxes asks about the deceased’s education. ­Here was another surprise. The increase in deaths of despair was almost all among t­hose without a bachelor’s degree. T­ hose with a four-­year degree are mostly exempt; it is ­those without the degree who are at risk. This was particularly surprising for suicide; for more than a ­century, suicides ­were generally more common among the educated,1 but that is not true in the current epidemic of deaths of despair.
The four-­year college degree is increasingly dividing Amer­ic­ a, and the extraordinarily beneficial effects of the degree are a constant theme ­running through the book. The widening gap between ­those with and without a bachelor’s degree is not only in death but also in quality of life; ­those without a degree are seeing increases in their levels of pain, ill health, and serious ­mental distress, and declines in their ability to work and to socialize. The gap is also widening in earnings, in ­family stability, and in community.2 A four-­year degree has become the key marker of social status, as if t­here ­were a requirement for nongraduates to wear a circular scarlet badge bearing the letters BA crossed through by a diagonal red line.
In the last half c­ entury, Amer­i­ca (like Britain and other rich countries) has built a meritocracy that we rightly see as a ­great achievement. But ­there is a dark side that was long ago predicted by Michael Young, the British economist and social scientist who in­ven­ted the term in 1958 and who saw meritocracy as leading to social calamity.3 T­ hose who do not pass the exams and gradua­ te to the cosmopolitan elite do not get to live in the fast-­growing, high-­tech, and flourishing cities and are assigned jobs threatened by globalization and by robots. The elite can sometimes be smug about their accomplishments, attributing them to their own merit, and dismissive of ­those without degrees, who had their chance but blew it. The less educated are devalued or even disrespected, are encouraged to think of themselves as losers, and may feel that the system is rigged

4 I n t r oduc t ion
so are the penalties for failing the tests of meritocracy. Young presciently referred to the left-­behind group as “the populists” and the elite as “the hy­poc­risy.”
We tell the story not only of death but of pain and addiction and of lives that have come apart and have lost their structure and significance. For Americans without a bachelor’s degree, marriage rates are in decline, though cohabitation and the fraction of ­children born out of wedlock continue to rise. Many middle-­aged men do not know their own ­children. They have parted from the ­woman with whom they once cohabited, and the ­children of that relationship are now living with a man who is not their ­father. The comfort that used to come from or­ga­nized religion, especially from the traditional churches, is now absent from many lives. ­People have less attachment to work; many are out of the ­labor force altogether, and fewer have a long-t­erm commitment to an employer who, in turn, was once committed to them, a relationship that, for many, conferred status and was one of the foundations of a meaningful life.
More workers used to belong to a ­union. Unions help keep wages up and help give workers some control over their workplace and working conditions. In many towns and cities, the ­union hall was a center of social life. The good wages that once supported the blue-­collar aristocracy have largely vanished, and manufacturing has been replaced by ser­vice jobs—­for example, in healthcare, in food preparation and ser­vice, in janitorial and cleaning ser­vices, and in maintenance and repair.
Our story of deaths of despair; of pain; of addiction, alcoholism, and suicide; of worse jobs with lower wages; of declining marriage; and of declining religion is mostly a story of non-­Hispanic white Americans without a four-­year degree. In 2018, the Census Bureau estimated that ­there ­were 171 million Americans between the ages of twenty-­five and sixty-­four. Of ­those, 62 ­percent ­were white non-­Hispanics, and 62 ­percent of ­those did not have a four-­year college degree; the less educated white Americans who are the group at risk are 38 ­percent of the working-a­ ge population. The economic forces that are harming ­labor are common to all working-­class Americans, regardless of race or ethnicity, but the stories of blacks and whites are markedly dif­fer­ent.

death in the afternoon  5
In the 1970s and 1980s, African Americans working in inner cities experienced events that, in retrospect, share some features with what happened to working-­class whites thirty years l­ater. The first wave of globalization hit blacks particularly hard, and jobs in the central city became scarce for this long-­disadvantaged group. Better-­educated and more talented blacks deserted the inner cities for safer city neighborhoods or the suburbs. Marriage rates fell as once-­marriageable men no longer had work.5 Crime rates r­ ose, as did mortality from vio­lence, from drug overdoses in the crack cocaine epidemic, and from HIV/AIDS, which disproportionately affected blacks. Blacks, always the least favored group, had that status reinforced by being the first to experience the downside of a changing national and global economy that was increasingly shedding less skilled workers.
African Americans have long had harder lives than whites. Blacks die younger, ­today as in the past. Blacks are also less likely to go to college, or to find employment. T­ hose who work earn less than whites on average. Blacks have less wealth, are less likely to own their own home, are more likely to be incarcerated, and more likely to live in poverty. In many but not all of t­ hese areas, black lives have improved; since 1970, black education, wages, income, and wealth have risen. From 1970 to 2000, black mortality rates declined by more than t­hose of whites, and they fell in the first fifteen years of the twenty-­first ­century while ­those of working-­ class whites ­were rising.
­There is less overt discrimination than in 1970. ­There has been a black president. The large majority who used to think intermarriage was wrong has now become a large majority who thinks it is just fine. Some whites undoubtedly resent the loss of their long-­standing white privilege in a way that hurts them but not blacks.6 Poor whites, it has long been said, suffered from a racist system that was primarily directed against blacks. Poor whites ­were co-­opted by the rich, who told them that they might not have much, but at least they ­were white. As Martin Luther King Jr. summarized, “The southern aristocracy took the world and gave the poor white man Jim Crow,” so that when he had no money for food, “he ate Jim Crow, a psychological bird that told him that no m­ atter how bad off he was, at least he was a white man, better than a black man.”7 As Jim Crow

6 I n t r oduc t ion
weakened, along with other forms of discrimination, working-­class whites lost what­ever benefits they got from it. More than half of white working-­ class Americans believe that discrimination against whites has become as big a prob­lem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities, while only 30 ­percent of white, college-­educated Americans agree.8 The historian Carol Anderson states that to someone who has “always been privileged, equality begins to look like oppression.”9
Black mortality rates remain above ­those for whites but, in the past three de­cades, the gap in mortality rates between blacks and whites with less than a bachelor’s degree fell markedly. Black rates, which ­were more than twice ­those of whites as late as the early 1990s, fell as white rates ­rose, closing the distance between them to 20 ­percent. Since 2013 the opioid epidemic has spread to black communities, but ­until then, the epidemic of deaths of despair was white.
In the chapters that follow, we document the decline of white working-­ class lives over the last half c­ entury. White non-­Hispanics are 62 ­percent of the working-­age population, so understanding their mortality is impor­ tant in and of itself. The story of what happened to African Americans in the seventies and eighties has been extensively researched and debated,10 and we have nothing to add to that lit­er­a­ture except to note that ­there are some parallels with whites t­oday. Hispanics are a widely heterogeneous group, defined only by their common language. US mortality trends for Hispanics change with changes in the composition of ­people who have immigrated—­for example, from Mexico, Cuba, or El Salvador; we do not try to tell a coherent story for them.
We describe the social and economic forces that have slowly made working-­class lives so much more difficult. One line of argument focuses on a decline in values or on an increasingly dysfunctional culture within the white working class itself.11 ­There is ­little doubt that the collapse of social norms about not having c­ hildren out of wedlock, which seemed so liberating to so many at first, has brought a heavy price in the long term. Young men who thought they could live a life f­ree of commitment found themselves alone and adrift in m­ iddle age. The turning away from religion is perhaps a similar force, but it is also pos­si­ble to think of it as a failure of or­ga­nized religion to adapt to po­litic­ al and economic change

death in the afternoon  7
and to continue to provide meaning and comfort in a changing world. ­These arguments about social norms are clearly right, but our story is primarily about the external forces that have eaten away the foundations that characterized working-­class life as it was half a c­ entury ago. T­ here is strong factual evidence against the view that workers brought the calamity on themselves by losing interest in work.
­After correction for inflation, the median wages of American men have been stagnant for half a ­century; for white men without a four-­year degree, median earnings lost 13 ­percent of their purchasing power between 1979 and 2017. Over the same period, national income per head grew by 85 ­percent. Although ­there was a welcome turnaround in earnings for the less educated between 2013 and 2017, it is very small compared with the long-­term decline. Since the end of the ­Great Recession, between January 2010 and January 2019 nearly sixteen million new jobs w­ ere created, but fewer than three million w­ ere for ­those without a four-­year degree. Only fifty-­five thousand ­were for ­those with only a high school degree.12
The prolonged decline in wages is one of the fundamental forces working against less educated Americans. But a ­simple link to despair from falling material living standards cannot by itself account for what has happened. For a start, the wage decline has come with job decline—­from better jobs to worse jobs—­with many leaving the l­abor force altogether ­because the worse jobs are unattractive, b­ ecause ­there are few jobs at all, or ­because they cannot easily move, or some combination of t­ hese reasons. Deterioration in job quality, and detachment from the l­abor force, bring miseries over and above the loss of earnings.
Many of the jobs that have come with the lower wages do not bring the sense of pride that can come with being part of a successful enterprise, even in a low-­ranked position. Cleaners, janitors, ­drivers, and customer ser­vice representatives “belonged” when they ­were directly employed by a large comp­ any, but they do not “belong” when the large com­pany outsources to a business-­service firm that offers low wages and ­little prospect of promotion. Even when workers are ­doing the same jobs that they did before they w­ ere outsourced, they are no longer part of a marquee corporation. As economist Nicholas Bloom memorably puts

8 I n t r oduc t ion
it, they are no longer invited to the holiday party.13 The days are gone when a janitor for Eastman Kodak could rise through the ranks to become the CEO of a related firm.14 In some of t­ hese jobs, working conditions are closely monitored by software that deprives workers of control or initiative, even compared with the old, and once much hated, assembly lines.15 Workers, even in dangerous, dirty occupations, such as coal mining, or in low-l­evel employment for famous corporations, could be proud of their roles.
Men without prospects do not make good marriage partners. Marriage rates among less educated whites fell, and more ­people lost out on the benefits of marriage, of seeing their c­ hildren grow, and of knowing their grandchildren. A majority of less educated white m­ others have currently had at least one child outside marriage. Poorer prospects make it harder for p­ eople to build the life that their parents had, to own a home, or to save to send kids to college. The lack of well-p­ aying jobs threatens communities and the ser­vices they provide, such as schools, parks, and libraries.
Jobs are not just the source of money; they are the basis for the rituals, customs, and routines of working-­class life. Destroy work and, in the end, working-­class life cannot survive. It is the loss of meaning, of dignity, of pride, and of self-­respect that comes with the loss of marriage and of community that brings on despair, not just or even primarily the loss of money.
Our account echoes the account of suicide by Emile Durkheim, the founder of sociology, of how suicide happens when society fails to provide some of its members with the framework within which they can live dignified and meaningful lives.16
We do not focus on economic hardship, though hardship undoubtedly exists. Whites without a college degree are not the poorest group in the US; they are much less likely to be poor than African Americans. Instead, we see the decline in wages as slowly undermining all aspects of ­people’s lives.
Why has the economy been failing the working class? If we are to come up with ideas for change, then we need to know what happened, where to begin, and what sort of policies might make a difference.

death in the afternoon  9
Again, we could turn to the failings of the ­people themselves and argue that, in the modern economy, it is impossible to prosper without a bachelor’s degree, and that p­ eople should simply get more education. We have nothing against education, and it has certainly become more valuable over time. We would like to see a world in which every­one who can benefit from ­going to college, and wants to go to college, is able to do so. But we do not accept the basic premise that ­people are useless to the economy ­unless they have a bachelor’s degree. And we certainly do not think that ­those who do not get one should be somehow disrespected or treated as second-­class citizens.
Globalization and technological change are often held up as the main villains b­ ecause they have reduced the value of uneducated ­labor, replacing it with cheaper, foreign ­labor or cheaper machines. Yet other rich countries, in Eur­ ope and elsewhere, face globalization and technological change but have not seen long-­term stagnation of wages, nor an epidemic of deaths of despair. ­There is something ­going on in Amer­i­ca that is dif­fer­ent, and that is particularly toxic for the working class. Much of this book is concerned with trying to find out just what that something might be.
We believe that the healthcare system is a uniquely American calamity that is undermining American lives. We s­ hall also argue that in Amer­i­ca, more than elsewhere, market and po­liti­cal power have moved away from l­abor ­toward capital. Globalization has aided the shift, both weakening ­unions and empowering employers,17 and American institutions have helped push this further than elsewhere. Corporations have become more power­ful as u­ nions have weakened, and as politics has become more favorable to them. In part, this comes from the phenomenal growth of high-­tech firms, such as Apple and Google, that employ few workers for their size and have high profits per worker. This is good for productivity and for national income, but ­little of the gain is shared by ­labor, especially by less educated ­labor. Less positively, consolidation in some American industries—­hospitals and airlines are just two of many examples—­has brought an increase in market power in some product markets so that it is pos­si­ble for firms to raise prices above what they would be in a freely competitive market. The rising economic and

10 I n t r oduc t ion
po­litic­ al power of corporations, and the declining economic and po­liti­ cal power of workers, allows corporations to gain at the expense of ordinary p­ eople, consumers, and particularly workers. At its worst, this power has allowed some phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal companies, protected by government licensing, to make billions of dollars from sales of addictive opioids that w­ ere falsely peddled as safe, profiting by destroying lives. More generally, the American healthcare system is a leading example of an institution that, ­under po­liti­cal protection, redistributes income upward to hospitals, physicians, device makers, and phar­ma­ceu­tic­ al companies while delivering among the worst health outcomes of any rich country.
As we write, in August 2019, the opioid manufacturers are being held to account in the courts; a judge ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay more than half a billion dollars to the state of Oklahoma. A subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson grew the poppies in Tasmania that w­ ere the raw material for almost all the opioids produced in the US. Early reports of a settlement with the worst offender, Purdue, the maker of OxyContin, suggest that the Sackler f­amily, who own the com­pany, may lose it, as well as several billion dollars of their past profit. Yet the aggressive marketing of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals to doctors and patients is still in place, as are the rules whereby the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of what is essentially legalized heroin. Many of t­hose who have followed the opioid scandal see ­little difference between the be­hav­ior of the legalized drug dealers and the illegal suppliers of heroin and cocaine who are so widely despised and condemned.18
The prob­lems with the healthcare industry go far beyond the opioid scandal. The US spends huge sums of money for some of the worst health outcomes in the Western world. We w­ ill argue that the industry is a cancer at the heart of the economy, one that has widely metastasized, bringing down wages, destroying good jobs, and making it harder and harder for state and federal governments to afford what their constituents need. Public purpose and the wellbeing of ordinary ­people are being subordinated to the private gain of the already well-­off. None of this would be pos­si­ble without the acquiescence—a­ nd sometimes enthusiastic participation—of the politicians who are supposed to act in the interest of the public.

Robin Hood was said to have robbed the rich to benefit the poor. What is happening t­ oday in Amer­i­ca is the reverse of Robin Hood, from poor to rich, what might be called a Sheriff of Nottingham re­distribution. Po­ liti­cal protection is being used for personal enrichment, by stealing from the poor on behalf of the rich, a pro­cess known to economists and po­liti­cal scientists as rent-­seeking. It is, in a sense, the opposite of free-­ market capitalism, and it is opposed by the Left, b­ ecause of its distributional consequences, and the Right, ­because it undermines freedom and a truly ­free market. It is as old as capitalism itself, as Adam Smith knew very well even in 1776. In his Wealth of Nations, often seen as the bible of capitalism, Smith noted that while tax laws could be cruel, they ­were “mild and gentle” in comparison with the laws that the pressure of “our merchants and manufacturers has extorted from the legislature, for the support of their own absurd and oppressive monopolies.” He suggested that “­these laws may be said to be all written in blood.”19 Rent-­ seeking is a major cause of wage stagnation among working-­class Americans and has had much to do with deaths of despair. We s­ hall have much to say about it.
The most common explanations for the decline in living standards of less educated Americans are that globalization has caused factories to close and move to Mexico or China and that automation has displaced workers. ­These forces are real enough, and they underlie much of our discussion. But, as the experience of other rich countries shows, globalization and automation, which are faced by all, need not reduce wages as has happened in the US, let alone bring an epidemic of death. American healthcare bears much of the blame, as does policy, particularly the failure to use antitrust to combat market power, in l­abor markets perhaps even more than goods markets, and to rein in the rent-­seeking by pharma, by healthcare more generally, and by banks and many small-­or medium-­ size business entrepreneurs, such as doctors, hedge fund man­ag­ers, the ­owners of sports franchises, real estate businesspeople, and car dealers. All of ­these get rich from the “oppressive monopolies” and special deals, tax breaks, and regulations that they have “extorted from the legislature.” The very top ranks of the American income distribution, the top 1 ­percenters and top tenth of 1 percenters, are less likely to be corporate

12 I n t r oduc t ion
heads than they are to be entrepreneurs who run their own businesses,20 many of whom are protected by rent-­seeking.
Ine­ quality is much cited for its baleful impacts. In this book, we see in­equality as a consequence as much as a cause; if the rich are allowed to enrich themselves through unfair pro­cesses that hold down wages, and raise prices, then in­equality ­will certainly rise. But not every­one gets rich that way. Some ­people invent new tools, drugs, or gadgets, or new ways of ­doing t­ hings, and benefit many, not just themselves. They profit from improving and extending other ­people’s lives. It is good for ­great innovators to get rich. Making is not the same as taking. It is not ine­ quality itself that is unfair but rather the pro­cess that generates it.
The ­people who are being left ­behind care about their own falling living standards and loss of community, not about Jeff Bezos (of Amazon) or Tim Cook (of Apple) being rich. Yet when they think the ine­ quality comes from cheating or from special f­avors, the situation becomes intolerable. The financial crisis has much to answer for. Before it, many believed that the bankers knew what they ­were ­doing and that their salaries ­were being earned in the public interest. Afterward, when so many ­people lost their jobs and their homes, and the bankers continued to be rewarded and ­were not held to account, American capitalism began to look more like a racket for redistributing upward than an engine of general prosperity.
We do not think that taxation is the solution to rent-­seeking; the right way to stop thieves is to stop them stealing, not to raise their taxes.21 We need to stop the abuse and overprescription of opioids, not tax the profits. We need to correct the pro­cess, not try to fix the outcomes. We need to make it easier for foreign doctors to qualify to practice in the US. We need to stop bankers and real estate dealers writing regulations and tax laws in their own interests. The prob­lem for less educated ­people is stagnant and declining wages, not in­equality in and of itself, and indeed much in­equality is the consequence of forcing down wages in order to enrich a minority. Reducing rent-­seeking would do much to reduce in­ equality. When the ­owners of a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal comp­ any get fabulously rich from the high prices, extended patents, approvals, and con­ve­nient regulations that their lobbyists have persuaded the government to grant,

de a t h i n t h e a f t e r no on  13
they greatly contribute to ine­ quality, both by pushing down the real incomes of t­hose who have to pay for the drugs and by pushing up the highest incomes at the top of the distribution. The same is true of the bankers who rewrote bankruptcy law in their ­favor and against borrowers; as one commentator noted, “Never before in our history has such a well-­organized, well-­orchestrated, and well-­financed campaign been run to change the balance of power between creditors and debtors.”22
As is often noted, even confiscatory taxes on the rich do not provide much relief for the poor, ­because ­there are so many poor ­people and so few rich p­ eople. In ­today’s world, however, we need to think about the pro­cess working in the other direction—­that squeezing even small amounts out of each of a large number of working ­people can provide enormous fortunes for the rich who are ­doing the squeezing. That is what is happening ­today, and we should stop it.
What might be done to make lives better, not just for the elite but also for working p­ eople? It is easy to be pessimistic. Once po­liti­cal and financial power are increasingly concentrated, the dynamic does not appear to be self-­correcting. The election of Donald Trump is understandable in the circumstances, but it is a gesture of frustration and rage that w­ ill make t­ hings worse, not better. Working-­class whites do not believe that democracy can help them; in 2016, more than two-­thirds of white working-­class Americans believed that elections are controlled by the rich and by big corporations, so that it does not m­ atter if they vote. Analys­ is by po­litic­ al scientists of voting patterns in Congress supports their skepticism; both Democ­ ratic and Republican lawmakers consistently vote for the interests of their more prosperous constituents with ­little attention to the interests of ­others.23
Justice Louis Brandeis campaigned against the misbehavior of ­giant trusts at the end of the nineteenth ­century and was ­later nominated to the Supreme Court by Woodrow Wilson, becoming its first Jewish member. He thought that extreme ine­ quality was incompatible with the preservation of democracy. This applies both to “good” and “bad” in­equality; it ­doesn’t m­ atter how ­people got rich if even ­those who earned their wealth legitimately use it to undermine the rights and interests of the nonrich. For us, the best way to deal with this is to stop the rent-­seeking,

14 I n t r oduc t ion
lobbying, and misuse of market power that is ­behind the extreme in­ equality, to stop the unfair proc­ ess. If that is impossible, high marginal income taxes or, better—­but practically much more difficult—a­ wealth tax would lessen the influence of fortunes in politics. But it is sometimes difficult to be optimistic. One historian has argued that ine­ quality, once it is established, is only overcome by violent ruptures and that this has been true since the Stone Age.24 We think that is too pessimistic, but it is hard to see ­today’s levels of ine­ quality lessening without reforms of the pro­cesses and institutions that produced them.
Yet t­ here are some reasons for optimism, and t­ here are policies that, even in our current flawed democracy, might be feasible and might make ­things better. Institutions can change. T­ here is much intellectual ferment around ­these issues, and many good new ideas that we ­will discuss ­later in the book. But we end this introduction with another, but more optimistic, historical parallel.
In Britain at the beginning of the nineteenth ­century, ine­ quality was greater than anything we see t­ oday. The hereditary landowners not only ­were rich but also controlled Parliament through a severely ­limited franchise. A­ fter 1815, the notorious Corn Laws kept out imports of wheat ­until the local price was so high that ­people ­were at risk of starving; high prices of wheat, even if they hurt ordinary p­ eople, ­were very much in the interests of the land-­owning aristocracy, who lived off the rents supported by the restriction on imports—­rent-­seeking of the classic and ­here literal kind, and rent-­seeking that did not stop at killing p­ eople; laws that ­were “written in blood.” The Industrial Revolution had begun, t­ here was a ferment of innovation and invention, and national income was rising. Yet working p­ eople ­were not benefiting. Mortality rates r­ ose as ­people moved from the relatively healthy countryside to stinking, unsanitary cities. Each generation of military recruits was shorter than the last, speaking to their ever-w­ orsening undernutrition in childhood, from not getting enough to eat and from the nutritional insults of unsanitary conditions. Religious observance fell, if only b­ ecause churches w­ ere in the countryside, not in the new industrial cities. Wages ­were stagnant and would remain so for half a ­century. Profits ­were rising, and the share of

de a t h i n t h e a f t e r no on  15
profits in national income ­rose at the expense of l­abor. It would have been hard to predict a positive outcome of this pro­cess.
Yet by c­ entury’s end, the Corn Laws w­ ere gone and the rents and fortunes of the aristocrats had fallen along with the world price of wheat, especially ­after 1870 when wheat from the American prairie flooded the market. A series of reform acts had extended the franchise, from one in ten males at the beginning of the ­century to more than half by its end, though the enfranchisement of ­women would wait ­until 1918.25 Wages had begun to rise in 1850, and the more than century-l­ong decline in mortality had begun.26 All of this happened without a collapse of the state, without a war or a pandemic, through gradual change in institutions that slowly gave way to the demands of t­ hose who had been left b­ ehind. Even if we do not know just why, or w­ hether the logic applies to our own times, the facts themselves surely justify at least a ­limited optimism.

Past as Prologue

The Calm before the Storm
Our nation has gained about one year of longevity ­every six years since 1990. A child born ­today can look forward to an average lifespan of about 78 years—­nearly three de­cades longer than a baby born in 1900. Deaths from heart disease have been reduced by more than 70 ­percent since I was born. HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention may now enable us to envision the first AIDS-­free generation since the virus emerged more than 30 years ago. Cancer death rates have been dropping about 1 p­ ercent annually for the past 15 years.

the twentieth c­ entury saw an improvement in health that was unpre­ce­dented in history. By 2000, continuously improving h­ uman health was the expected, normal state of events. C­ hildren lived longer than their parents, who, in turn, lived longer than their parents. De­cade by de­cade, the risk of ­dying fell. Better health was supported by better living standards, by advances in medicines and treatments, and by changes in be­hav­ior based on a better understanding of how be­hav­ior—­especially cigarette smoking—­affected health. Other rich countries saw similar improvements for similar reasons. In poor countries, especially in the second half of the twentieth c­ entury, improvements w­ ere even more
19

20  c h a p t e r 1
spectacular. In 2000, all of this pro­gress seemed set to continue, presumably in­def­i nitely.
Economic pro­gress was remarkable, too. Almost every­one in the world was richer in 2000 than their grandparents, or great-­or great-­great-­ grandparents, had been when Queen Victoria died and Louis Armstrong was born in 1901, adding to another ­century of pro­gress before that, from 1800 to 1900. In the rich countries of western Eur­ ope and North Amer­ i­ca, the rate of income growth reached its all-­time high in the period known in France as Les trente glorieuses, the thirty years ­after the Second World War. During t­hose years in the United States, not only was the growth of national income per head faster than ever before, it was also widely shared by rich, poor, and ­middle class alike.
Education is a similar story. In 1900, only a quarter of p­ eople graduated from high school; by midcentury more than three-­quarters did. ­Those with a college degree ­rose from one in twenty to one in five. And while better-­educated ­people generally earned more than ­those with less education, the midcentury postwar l­abor market provided good jobs for ­those with only a high school diploma. Factory jobs, in steel works or auto plants, provided a good living, especially as ­people moved up the ladder. Men followed their ­fathers into ­unionized jobs, often with a lifetime commitment from both workers and the firm. Wages w­ ere high enough for a man to get married, to start a f­amily and buy a h­ ouse, and to enjoy the prospect of a life that was better in many ways than the life of his parents at the same age. Parents could think about sending their ­children to college to give them an even better life. ­Those ­were the days of what has been called the blue-­collar aristocracy.
The last ­thing we want to argue is that the twentieth c­ entury was a paradise that was lost in the twenty-­first. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The twentieth c­ entury also saw many of the worst catastrophes in history, in which tens or even hundreds of millions of p­ eople lost their lives. Two world wars and the murderous regimes of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao are the worst events in terms of the raw counts of ­people killed, but ­there w­ ere also deadly epidemics, including the influenza at the end of the First World War and HIV/AIDS at ­century’s end. Millions of the

T h e C a l m b e f or e t h e S t or m  21
world’s ­children died from common childhood diseases long ­after it was understood how to prevent ­those deaths. Wars, mass murders, epidemics, and the unnecessary deaths of ­children brought down life expectancy, sometimes very sharply. ­There ­were economic catastrophes too, and wellbeing was far from universally shared. The G­ reat Depression brought poverty and misery to millions. Jim Crow was alive and well, institutionalizing educational, economic, and social deprivation for black Americans.
Nor is our claim that t­here was constant, steady pro­gress, only that, over a long period, such as from 1900 to 2000, p­ eople w­ ere less likely to die and more likely to prosper. Some outcomes showed steadier pro­gress than ­others, and some countries did better than o­ thers. But pro­gress in health and in living standards in the twentieth c­ entury was prolonged enough that, by ­century’s end, ­people could reasonably expect it to continue and to bless their ­children’s lives just as it had blessed their own. For most of the world’s population, the end of the twentieth ­century saw greater prosperity and greater longevity than at any time in history. Not only that, but the rate of improvement since the end of the Second World War had been so steady and so prolonged that it seemed obvious that ­future generations would do better still.
To understand ­these past changes, as well as the much less beneficent changes that we ­will describe in this book, we need to clarify how pro­ gress is mea­sured.
Life and Death: Keeping Score
We ­shall frequently talk about mortality and life expectancy. They are, in a sense, opposites; mortality meas­ ures d­ ying, and life expectancy mea­ sures the length of life. The mortality rate is the risk of ­dying; life expectancy is how many years a newborn can be expected to live. When and where mortality rates are high, life expectancy is low, and vice versa. Mortality rates are dif­fer­ent at dif­fer­ent ages—­high among babies and young ­children, then low among older c­ hildren, teen­agers, and young adults. In ­middle age, the threat of death begins to be real, and ­after age thirty, the risk of ­dying increases ­every year. In the US in 2017, the probability

22  c h a p t e r 1
of ­dying between thirty and thirty-­one was 1.3 in 1,000, by age forty it was 2.0 in 1,000, by fifty it was 4.1 per 1,000, and by sixty it was 9.2 per 1,000. Through midlife, the probability of ­dying doubles for ­every de­cade of life. In other rich countries, ­these risks are a ­little lower, but in the absence of epidemics or wars, patterns like ­these appear in all places and all times.
For a newborn, we think of life as a hurdle race, with a hurdle at each birthday. Mortality rates are the probabilities of falling at each hurdle, high at the beginning u­ ntil the newborn hits his or her stride, then low for a while as the more experienced runner deals easily with each hurdle, and then getting higher and higher in midlife and old age as the runner tires. Throughout the book we w­ ill talk about life expectancy, which is how many hurdles an average newborn can be expected to clear, as well as about mortality rates, which are the probabilities of falling at each of the hurdles. We need both concepts, ­because the events that we are ­going to describe affect dif­fer­ent hurdles differently, so that risks can rise in ­middle age even when they are falling among the eld­ erly, something that may not show up in life expectancy at all if ­these changes happen to cancel each other out.
When the hurdles are high at the beginning, not many runners are ­going to get far down the track. In the US, at the beginning of the twentieth ­century, c­ hildren faced high risks of d­ ying. Not all ­children got enough or good enough food, childhood diseases like measles w­ ere often fatal, vaccinations w­ ere far from universal, and many places in the US had yet to make their w­ ater safe to drink, failing to properly separate the disposal of sewage from the provision of drinking w­ ater, among other ­things. It is not only unpleasant but extremely dangerous to drink out of a river that someone ­else, living upstream, is using as a toilet. It is expensive to supply safe ­water and good sanitation, and it took public health officials a long time to make ­these arrangements everywhere, even once the basic science—t­ he germ theory of disease—­was understood and accepted.
The chance of d­ ying increases with age, except at the very beginning of life. Life is most dangerous for babies and for the el­derly. In rich countries, infancy is safe; only six out of one thousand American babies do not live to their first birthday, and other countries do even better. In Sweden and Singapore, for example, only two out of one thousand die.

T h e C a l m b e f or e t h e S t or m  23
The risks are much higher in some poor countries, but even h­ ere, pro­ gress has been rapid, and t­ here is not a single country in the world whose infant mortality rate is higher now than it was fifty years ago.
Over the twentieth c­ entury, overall life expectancy at birth in the United States increased from 49 to 77 years. By the end of the c­ entury, from 1970 to 2000, life expectancy increased from 70.8 to 76.8, 2 additional years of life for e­ very de­cade of a­ ctual time. From 1933, when the comprehensive US data begin, the trend has been almost continuously positive, with declines in life expectancy lasting no more than one or two years. While the data before 1933 are not complete, ­because not all states kept rec­ords, ­there appears to have been a three-­year decline from 1915 to 1918 at the end of the First World War and during the influenza epidemic.
Had this rate of increase continued, life expectancy by 2100 could have been expected to be more than ninety, with substantial fractions of p­ eople living to be one hundred. Similar statements can be made for the countries of Western Eu­rope and for Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.
The Changing Face of Mortality
In 1900, the three leading ­causes of death ­were infectious diseases—­ pneumonia, tuberculosis, and gastrointestinal infections. By midcentury, with the public health and vaccination programs largely complete, and with antibiotics in­ven­ted and about to be widely used, infectious disease had become less impor­tant as a cause of death. The early-­life hurdles had been lowered and mortality moved into ­middle and old age. Death itself aged, moving out of the bowels of ­children and into the lungs and arteries of the middle-­aged and el­derly. Once this happens, it is much harder to increase life expectancy. Lowering the hurdles at the beginning makes a big difference to how far p­ eople run, but once almost every­one makes it into ­middle and old age, saving lives among the el­derly stretches life spans by much less.
By the end of the twentieth ­century, the leading c­ auses of death w­ ere heart disease and cancer. Heart disease and lung cancer become less common when ­people stop smoking, and the substantial reductions in the

24  c h a p t e r 1
portion of the population who smoked made a large contribution to falling mortality. Preventive treatments for heart disease also helped. Antihypertensives are cheap and easy-­to-­take drugs that help control blood pressure and make heart attacks less likely; statins are cholesterol-­ lowering drugs that help to reduce heart attacks and strokes. The reduction in heart disease mortality was one of the g­ reat success stories of the last quarter of the twentieth c­ entury. ­There w­ ere also drug-­based and screening successes against some cancers, including breast cancer.
New drugs are perhaps not as impor­tant for reducing death rates as are ­people’s be­hav­iors, but they are nevertheless often life saving, and when, ­later in the book, we talk about excesses in the phar­ma­ceu­tic­ al industry, it should always be kept in mind that drugs have saved many lives. The world would be a much worse place without antibiotics, without insulin for diabetes, without aspirin or ibuprofen, without anesthetics, without antihypertensives, without antiretrovirals, or without the birth control pill. The key puzzle for public policy is to find a way of getting the benefits of longer and better lives without socially unacceptable consequences, including, but ­going beyond, financial costs.
As some diseases are eliminated and ­others reduced, other ­causes step up to take their place as leaders. Most of ­these c­ auses are not new. They have always been t­ here but w­ ere previously dwarfed by the scale of the ­earlier mass killers. Some c­ auses of death, such as Alzheimer’s or late-l­ife cancers, ­were uncommon simply b­ ecause ­people rarely reached the ages where they m­ atter. But other c­ auses, such as accidents, suicides, or diabetes, w­ ere always pre­sent but ­were minor killers in the age of smallpox or cholera or even, in more recent times, tuberculosis or childhood diarrhea. As we move away from infectious disease, the nature of c­ auses also changes. Infections are spread by an agent, such as a bacterium or a virus, so that discovering the biological mechanisms in the body or in the means of transmission—­dirty ­water, mosquitoes, fleas, or rats—­offers not only an understanding of the cause but also a potential route to its cure or even elimination.
But biology is never every­thing—­where and how p­ eople live always plays a part. When it comes to smoking-­related disease or to suicide, poisoning, or accidents, biology, as we ­shall see throughout the book, is

T h e C a l m b e f or e t h e S t or m  25
often less impor­tant than be­hav­ior or the economic and social conditions ­under which p­ eople live.
Biology and Be­hav­ior
The root cause of an epidemic of typhus in 1848, as the g­ reat pathologist Rudolf Virchow saw it, was poverty and lack of po­liti­cal repre­sen­ta­ tion. Robert Koch, the founder of microbiology, who identified the bacteria responsible for cholera, tuberculosis, and anthrax, triumphantly wrote, “One has been accustomed ­until now to regard tuberculosis as the outcome of social misery and to hope by relief of distress to diminish the disease. But in the final strug­gle against this dreadful plague of the ­human race one ­will no longer have to contend with an indefinite something but with an ­actual parasite.”1 The dichotomy between biology and be­hav­ior is an old one that has often been fought over. In the deaths we ­will discuss, be­hav­ior ­will usually be the key, and we w­ ill not focus on an ­actual parasite. We do not need much biology to understand how a gun kills, or how a traffic accident can maim, yet biology controls how eating and exercise affect obesity, how stress ­causes pain, how alcohol destroys the liver, or how smoking c­ auses heart disease. We need always to bring social science and medicine together.
Figure 1.1 illustrates t­ hese ideas. It shows mortality rates in midlife for white Americans from 1900 to 2000. The line shows the death rate for men and ­women aged forty-­five to fifty-­four in each year. In ­later chapters, we explore death rates at other ages, but we ­shall often highlight this midlife age-­group. It is in midlife that death rates pick up, and it is often a good place to see evolving trends in mortality. Death in midlife is rare and is usually shown as the number out of e­ very 100,000 who die in a year. The numbers in the figure start out at around 1,500 (1.5 ­percent a year) in 1900 and fall to around 400 (0.4 ­percent a year) in 2000. This reduction, of more than two-t­ hirds, is the main takeaway from the graph. We ­will see that t­ here ­were similar reductions in death rates for other age and ethnic and racial groups.
Other notable events can be seen. The spike in mortality in 1918 is the influenza epidemic that swept the United States and the world at the end

of the First World War. T­ here was some slowdown in pro­gress during the 1930s and the ­Great Depression, but pro­gress was also slow in the booming 1920s; ­there is no obvious relationship between mortality rates and the state of the economy. Indeed, research ­going back into the 1920s has documented the somewhat surprising results that deaths are often higher when the economy is ­doing well.2 Mortality decline stagnated for several years around 1960 when many of ­those who had smoked heavi­ly in their twenties and thirties died of lung cancer and heart disease. ­After 1970, mortality decline resumed in force, largely driven by the decline in mortality from heart disease. The post-1970 pattern also appears in other rich countries with the spread of knowledge about the harmful effects of smoking and as doctors prescribed pills to control hypertension and cholesterol.
Figure 1.1 shows all the main d­ rivers of death. Epidemic disease is represented by influenza, itself conditioned by the economic, social, and ­human devastation of the ­Great War. Be­hav­ior shows in smoking, medical knowledge in the understanding of the effects of smoking, and the medical care system in the control of high blood pressure.

T h e C a l m b e f or e t h e S t or m  27
Figure 1.1 looks only at whites aged forty-­five to fifty-­four. But other groups also benefited from declining mortality in the twentieth ­century. African Americans are more likely to die than white Americans and have shorter life expectancy; this has long been true, and it is true ­today. But black men and w­ omen have also seen pro­gress, at faster rates than whites, and the gap between black and white mortality rates has been narrowing. Death rates have also fallen among the eld­ erly. In 1900, a sixty-­year-­ old American ­woman could expect to live fifteen more years, and a man of the same age could expect to live another fourteen years; by the end of the c­ entury, ­those numbers had risen to twenty-­three for ­women and twenty for men.
We know rather less about trends in morbidity—­sickness other than death—­than about trends in mortality. Yet we can be sure not just that ­people ­were living longer but also that their lives ­were better and healthier. For the last quarter c­ entury, we have direct meas­ ures from surveys that ask ­people about disability, pain, and their ability to undertake routine tasks. It was once feared that, as ­people lived to older ages, their old age would be one of pain and disability, not dead but sick, but this did not happen. Medical advances have not just reduced mortality but also helped ­people live better when they are alive. Joint replacements reduce pain and allow p­ eople to function in ways that would have been impossible without them. Cataract surgery restores the sight of ­those who would other­wise lose it. And drugs are sometimes effective at reducing pain and relieving depression and other ­mental distress.
Americans also became taller, which is a good reflection of improvements in nutrition and public health in their childhood. Men born in 1980 ­were about an inch and a half taller as adults than t­ hose born a c­ entury before. Other rich countries did even better. Americans used to be the tallest ­people in the world, but they have now been overtaken by Germans, Norwegians, and especially the Dutch—a­ sign, perhaps, that not all is well.3

­Things Come Apart
by its end, much of the optimism of the twentieth ­century had faded. Towns and cities in the heartland of Amer­i­ca that used to produce steel, glass, furniture, or shoes, and that are fondly remembered by ­people in their seventies as having been ­great places to grow up, had been gutted, their factories closed and shops boarded up. In the wreckage, the temptations of alcohol and drugs lured many to their deaths. Most of ­these stories are never told. Stigma often removes the cause of death from obituaries when suicide, overdose, or alcoholism is involved. Addiction is seen as a moral weakness, not a disease, and it is believed that its effects are best covered up.
Exceptions are made when a famous chef kills himself or a ­music icon overdoses on fentanyl, or when the death is shocking to the community—­ for example, as reported by Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster, “in a ­little town called Keene New Hampshire. ­There’s not a quieter place on this earth, and a beloved high school teacher, m­ other of three c­ hildren, died of a heroin overdose.”1 Each story is real and tragic, but it needs to be considered in perspective. When we look at the numbers, all the numbers, we see an even bigger, more frightening, and tragic story. The events that reach the media are selected for their news value, celebrities get attention, and the firsthand accounts of addiction or attempted suicide often come from ­those who are accustomed to writing about their experiences. Spectacular and unusual deaths—­upper-­class suicides and drug deaths—­are exhaustively reported; t­ hose of ordinary p­ eople rarely make headlines, although they too leave ­behind devastated families and
28

­Things Come Apar  29
friends. T­ oday’s events are news; long-­term trends are yesterday’s news, which usually means not news at all. Deaths from lung cancer, heart disease, or diabetes are not news in and of themselves—l­ung cancer is not like Ebola or AIDS, though it takes many more lives—a­ nd we find out about them only incidentally when we read obituaries. Without the numbers to make comparisons, we ­don’t know ­whether we are looking at an event, like a plane crash or a terrorist attack, where the deaths are few but shocking and newsworthy, or an epidemic, like Ebola or SARS, which terrified many but killed few, or w­ hether we are dealing with something much larger, something that actually threatens the public health and upends a c­ entury of pro­gress in ­human health.
All deaths in the US are reported to the authorities, and the information is assembled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. When someone dies, a ­great deal of information is collected on the death certificate, including, for the last thirty years, the highest level of education attained. The CDC has a website, charmingly called CDC Won­der, where much of this information is readily available. The death certificates themselves, with confidential information (such as name and social security number) removed, can also be downloaded and examined. It is with ­these data that we begin.
They are e­ very bit as distressing as the stories.
American Exceptionalism, Breaking with the Past, and Leaving the Herd: The Facts
We saw in the previous chapter that the mortality rate for midlife whites in the US was 1,500 per 100,000 in 1900, and that by 2000 it had fallen to 400 per 100,000. We now follow this group into the twenty-­first ­century.
We can also look at other countries around the world that, like the United States, are rich in terms of income per head and that share and implement the scientific and medical knowledge that is common across such countries. ­Those countries showed rapid declines in midlife mortality a­ fter 1945, and as in the US, the decline was particularly rapid a­ fter

1970. In almost all wealthy countries, mortality rates for ­those aged forty-­five to fifty-­four declined at an average rate of 2 ­percent per year from the late 1970s to 2000.
Figure 2.1 shows what happened. We call this the “­things come apart” picture. Midlife mortality continued to decline in France, Britain, and Sweden; other rich countries, not shown, display similar pro­gress. An entirely dif­f er­ent pattern emerged for US white non-­Hispanic Americans. Not only did whites not keep pace with mortality declines in other countries, but mortality for them ­stopped falling altogether and began to rise.
The ­future that we might have predicted for white Americans in midlife,2 based on what had happened in the twentieth ­century, is shown ­here by the thick dotted line. Over time, white mortality pulled markedly away from what was seen in other wealthy countries, and what we might have predicted its path to be.
Something impor­tant, awful, and unexpected is happening. But is it just white men and ­women in ­middle age, or are other age-­groups affected

­Things Come Apar  31
too? Is it men more than ­women, or ­women more than men? And what about other groups? Is it focused in one part of the country, or much the same everywhere? And, above all, why is it happening? As we ­shall see, the alcohol, suicide, and opioid epidemics are an essential part of the story, but we need to discuss a few other issues before we get ­there.
In chapter 1, when we showed falling midlife mortality through the twentieth c­ entury, we noted that other age-­groups also benefited. But the reversal in figure 2.1 is not universally shared. As we ­shall see, while ­there have been similar changes in mortality trends for younger age-­groups, mortality among the el­derly continued to fall as it had done at the end of the twentieth c­ entury. We ­shall explore this a good deal further as we go, and we ­shall see that the reversal has begun to affect the youn­gest el­ derly too.
In figure 2.1 we switched from all whites to non-­Hispanic whites, a narrower category for which data did not exist for most of the twentieth ­century. Hispanics, who are much poorer on average than non-­Hispanics, have lower mortality rates than non-­Hispanics, and their pro­gress kept pace with that in other countries; their mortality rates look like t­ hose for Britain over this period. African Americans have higher mortality rates than any of the groups or countries shown in the picture, but their rate of mortality decline has been faster than for any of the groups or countries shown ­here. The midlife gap between US black and white mortality fell dramatically between 1990 and 2015, a­ fter which point the decline in midlife black mortality also came to an end, likely linked to opioids, as we ­shall see. The story of racial differences in mortality is an impor­tant one, and we ­shall ­later argue that the differences between black and white mortality rates can be reconciled once we look carefully at the history. The differences have less to do with what than with when.
­These differences in mortality by race and ethnicity are far from fully understood, but they have existed for many years. For African Americans, ­there is widespread agreement that the worse outcomes, like so many other impor­tant outcomes, are tied to long-­standing discrimination, as well as to poorer access to high-­quality medical care.3 The superior longevity of Hispanics over non-­Hispanic whites has been much researched but not fully explained. It is worth noting that other groups, such as Asian

32  c h a p t e r 2
Americans, do better still, better than e­ ither Hispanics or whites. As to the recent trends, which have been so dif­fer­ent across the three main groups, we w­ ill return to them repeatedly throughout the book, though we should confess from the start that we ­shall find much that is not easy to explain.
Figure 2.1 is drawn for men and ­women together, which is always potentially misleading. ­Women have lower mortality rates than men throughout life, and so they live longer, about five years longer in the US. Men and w­ omen suffer from dif­fer­ent diseases, and to dif­fer­ent extents from the same diseases and be­hav­iors: men, for example, are three to four times more likely than w­ omen to kill themselves. But the turnaround—­ from continual pro­gress in the twentieth ­century to stalled pro­gress, or even regression, in the twenty-­first—­has happened to both men and ­women in midlife, though the reversal is somewhat larger for w­ omen than men. Even so, the gaps between whites in the US and other countries and between US whites and what we might have expected are large for both men and ­women, so that the figure does not mislead by taking men and ­women together.4
One meas­ ure of the importance of the white mortality reversal is to compare what actually happened with the trend shown by the dotted line. The gap between the two lines shows the difference in mortality rates in each year, from which we can calculate for each year how many ­people aged forty-­five to fifty-­four died who would have been alive had late twentieth-­century pro­gress continued. When we add up t­ hose numbers from 1999, the critical point where the turnaround began, to 2017, we get a very large total: 600,000 deaths of midlife Americans who would be alive if pro­gress had gone on as expected. One immediate point of reference is the approximately 675,000 Americans who have died from HIV/ AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic in the early 1980s. We s­ hall refine our estimate as we go, extend it to other age-­groups, and attribute it to specific ­causes, but it w­ ill serve for now as a ballpark estimate of what is involved, and to establish that what we are dealing with is indeed a major catastrophe.
Another meas­ ure of importance is to look at what has been happening to life expectancy at birth. ­Because life expectancy is more sensitive

­Things Come Apar  33
to deaths at younger ages, only large changes in midlife mortality can affect it. For whites, life expectancy at birth fell by one-t­enth of a year between 2013 and 2014. In the next three years, between 2014 and 2015, 2015 and 2016, and again between 2016 and 2017, life expectancy fell for the US population as a w­ hole. ­These declines reflect mortality at all ages, not just in midlife, but are, in fact, heavi­ly influenced by what has been happening to whites in midlife. Any decline in life expectancy is extremely uncommon. With a three-­year decline, we are in unfamiliar territory; American life expectancy has never fallen for three years in a row since states’ vital registration coverage was completed in 1933.5 For the subset of states that had registration of deaths before then, the only pre­ce­dent is a ­century ago, from 1915 through 1918, during the First World War and the influenza epidemic that followed it. Catastrophes indeed.
The Geography of Mortality
If we are to begin to understand why ­these deaths are happening, we can first look for clues on where the deaths are happening. If we look across states at the changes in mortality rates for whites aged forty-­five to fifty-­ four from 1999 to 2017, we find the increases in all but six states, with the largest increases in death rates in West V­ irginia, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Mississippi, all states with education levels lower than the national average. The only states where midlife white mortality fell by a noticeable amount ­were California, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois, all states with high levels of education.
A more detailed geography is shown in figure 2.2, where mortality rates for midlife whites are presented for about a thousand small areas across the United States in 2000 on the left and in 2016 on the right. T­ hese small areas are counties or, if the population of a county is small, a collection of adjacent counties. Darker areas indicate higher mortality, so the maps show high mortality in the West (except California), Appalachia, and the South in 2000, intensifying and spreading by 2016 into new areas, such as Maine, upper Michigan, and parts of Texas.
We ­will refer back to the patterns in t­ hese maps throughout the book.

Carrying Their Trou­bles with Them: Age versus Cohort Effects
Figure 2.1 compares death rates across countries for one specific age-­ group, ­those aged forty-­five to fifty-­four, but our concerns do not end ­there. White mortality pro­gress has reversed throughout adulthood, in

­Things Come Apar  35
contrast to what is happening in the rest of the rich world. We highlight the midlife group, ­those aged forty-­five to fifty-­four. But, as we w­ ill see, rising mortality is not simply a baby-­boomer phenomenon. For US whites, the hurdles at younger ages have also been raised.
The f­uture of t­oday’s midlife adults is also in question. W­ ill ­those in midlife “age out” of the mortality crisis if they survive? Or w­ ill they carry their trou­bles with them as they age, so that tomorrow’s eld­ erly w­ ill suffer like t­oday’s m­ iddle aged? El­derly Americans receive benefits, such as healthcare from Medicare and pensions from Social Security, that are not available to t­ hose in ­middle age so that, if ­these benefits are good for health, ­there is an argument for the positive alternative. But if the midlife deaths are happening to p­ eople born around 1950 b­ ecause of the conditions ­under which they have lived their lives, or ­because of the way they have chosen to live their lives, ­there can be no expectation that they ­will do better as they age. Unfortunately, recent data are more consistent with the second, more negative outcome. The midlife increase in mortality has now begun to affect the eld­ erly, as the birth cohorts born a­ fter the Second World War begin to move into old age. The all-­cause mortality rate for whites ages sixty-­five to seventy-­four fell on average 2 ­percent per year between the early 1990s and 2012; since 2012, their mortality has ­stopped falling.
Social scientists often try to isolate two dif­f er­ent phenomena. On the one hand, ­there may be “age” effects, when an outcome is tied to age, and on the other hand, “cohort” effects, when outcomes are attached to ­people born around the same time and are carried with them as they age. Cohort and age effects are not, of course, mutually exclusive, nor do they exhaust all of the possibilities. We ­will argue for (a version of) the cohort interpretation, which is, unfortunately, the more pessimistic of the two accounts. ­There is something about ­these ­people that makes them susceptible and that they carry with them through life. Discovering the nature of that something is our task in the rest of this book.
­There are two stories, often seen as competing, though they need not be. One, the “external” or circumstantial account, emphasizes what happened to p­ eople, the opportunities that they had, the kind of education, occupation, or social environment that was available to them. The

36  c h a p t e r 2
alternative, “internal” account emphasizes what ­people did to themselves, not their opportunities but their choices among t­ hose opportunities, or their own preferences. It is a debate between worsening opportunities, on the one hand, and worsening preferences, or declining values or even virtues, on the other.
Before we can take the story further, we have to return to our midlife Americans in the early twenty-­first ­century and find out more about the ­causes of their deaths. Not surprisingly, suicide, opioids, and alcoholism feature in the story, but they are by no means the only players.

Deaths of Despair
becky manning: He just carried this tremendous guilt for every­thing, for our son ­doing drugs. Then he started getting depressed, and then my husband took his own life.
paul solman: How did he do it? becky manning: He blew his head off. I came home to that. paul solman: Best friend Marcy Conner’s husband also killed
himself. marcy conner: He developed alcoholism very young in life. paul solman: An addiction he shared with lifelong friends. marcy conner: One died with a heart attack, but drug use and
alcohol use played all the way through his life. Another one died of cancer, drank up to the very end. And my husband actually had a G-­tube in, a feeding tube in, and poured alcohol down his feeding tube u­ ntil he died.1
What are middle-­aged white Americans ­dying from? The foregoing extract, from an interview in Kentucky that aired on PBS, manages, in only a few words, to capture the three dif­fer­ent ­causes of death that we have come to call deaths of despair: suicide, drugs, and alcohol. It also shows how they are often closely related. Becky Manning’s husband killed himself b­ ecause of depression over his son’s drug use. Manning’s husband and his friends abused alcohol and drugs throughout their adult lives, and Marcy Conner’s husband died by pouring alcohol directly into his stomach. One of the friends died of a heart attack in which alcohol could
37

38  c h a p t e r 3
have been indirectly involved, if it promoted a heart attack in someone who already had long-­standing heart disease.
When we first saw an early version of the “coming apart” graph, we asked ourselves what ­people ­were d­ ying of, which sent us back to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data to see what kinds of deaths had been rising most rapidly since 1999, the year white mortality rates began to rise. ­There ­were three immediate culprits. In order of importance, they w­ ere accidental or intent-­undetermined poisonings (which are almost entirely drug overdoses), suicides, and alcoholic liver diseases and cirrhosis. While ­there are more deaths from drug overdoses than from ­either suicides or alcohol-­related diseases, suicides and alcohol together kill more whites than do drugs. All three kinds of death are impor­tant. Death continues its journey. Having moved from the bowels of ­children into the lungs and arteries of the el­derly, it is now backtracking into the minds, livers, and veins of the middle-­aged.
The rapid rise in t­hese deaths is affecting Americans, particularly whites, but not ­people in other rich countries. ­There have been increases in drug overdoses in other English-­speaking countries—­Canada, Ireland, Britain (especially Scotland), and Australia—­and an increase in alcohol-­ related deaths in Britain and Ireland. (The data do not allow us to separate out deaths by ethnic or racial groups in ­these or in other rich countries.) ­These rising deaths elsewhere are serious threats to public health and may become more serious in the f­uture. But, apart from drug deaths in Scotland, the numbers are very small compared with t­hose in the United States. In the US, at least u­ ntil 2013, when a deadly opioid, fentanyl, hit the streets, neither blacks nor Hispanics saw a rise in deaths of despair.
Although the surge in deaths in Amer­i­ca is what we might see during the ravages of an infectious disease, like the ­Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918, this is an epidemic that is not carried by a virus or a bacterium, nor is it caused by an external agent, such as poisoning of the air or the fallout from a nuclear accident. Instead, p­ eople are d­ oing this to themselves. They are drinking themselves to death, or poisoning themselves with drugs, or shooting or hanging themselves. Indeed, as we ­shall repeatedly see, the three c­ auses of death are deeply related, and it is often hard

De a t h s of De s pa i r  39
for the coroner or medical examiner to classify a death; it is not always easy to tell a suicide from an accidental overdose. All the deaths show g­ reat unhappiness with life, ­either momentary or prolonged. It is tempting to classify them all as suicides, done e­ ither quickly, with a gun or by standing on and kicking away a chair with a rope around the neck, or slowly, with drugs or alcohol. Even so, many addicts do not want to die, even when they see death as the almost inevitable outcome of their addiction.
The vast majority of drug deaths are classified as “accidental poisonings,” but t­ hese are not accidents in the same sense as falling off a ladder or being electrocuted by mistakenly touching a live wire. Certainly, some ­people get the dose wrong and accidentally inject themselves with more heroin than their systems can tolerate, or miscalculate the risk of combining drugs and alcohol. But what about the addicts who, when hearing of an “accidental death” nearby, seek out the dealer to make sure that they too can obtain high-­strength drugs? Or t­ hose who seek out fentanyl, a drug that is many times stronger and more dangerous than heroin? The Washington Post reported the story of Amanda Bennett of Baltimore, aged twenty-­six, who became addicted to opioids a­ fter a C-­section, progressed to heroin, and then to fentanyl-­laced heroin, and who noted, “If ­there is no fentanyl in it, I ­don’t want it at all.”2
­People who seek out such drugs are not seeking death, just a power­ ful high or temporary relief from their cravings, but the high risk of death is no deterrent. T­ here are addicts who, having overdosed, are miraculously brought back to life with a dose of naloxone (Narcan), only to overdose again within hours. Alcohol addiction is less immediately dangerous than addiction to opioids, and ­there are high-­functioning alcoholics just as ­there are some high-­functioning drug addicts. But ­there are also ­those who have lost their families, their jobs, and their lives to their addiction—a­ ddiction is a prison that separates its victims from a life worth living.
Robert DuPont, the first director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, argues that the two essential characteristics of addiction are continued use of a substance despite serious consequences caused by that use, and dishonesty.3 What he has called the “selfish brain” takes control and leaves no room for anything but the craving.4 ­People who put

40  c h a p t e r 3
themselves at risk of d­ ying from the side effects of alcohol or drugs have already lost much of what makes life worth living, paralleling the loss experienced by many of ­those who decide to kill themselves.
We call the three kinds of death “deaths of despair.” It is a con­ve­nient label, indicating the link with unhappiness, the link with ­mental or behavioral health, and the lack of any infectious agent, but it is not intended to identify the specific c­ auses of despair. We s­ hall have a g­ reat deal to say about ­those background ­causes, or “­causes of ­causes,” in what follows. For now, it is simply a good label. Deaths of despair among white men and ­women aged forty-­five to fifty-­four ­rose from thirty per one hundred thousand in 1990 to ninety-t­ wo per one hundred thousand in 2017. In ­every US state, suicide mortality rates for whites aged forty-­five to fifty-­ four increased between 1999–2000 and 2016–17. In all but two states, mortality rates from alcoholic liver disease r­ ose.5 And in e­ very state, drug overdose mortality rates increased.
We w­ ere far from the first to see the rise of drug overdoses. The current epidemic began in the early 1990s and gained momentum in 1996 with the Food and Drug Administration’s approval and the subsequent marketing of the addictive prescription painkiller OxyContin, essentially legalized heroin, manufactured by Purdue Phar­ma­ceut­ i­cal. Scholars who worked on alcohol-­related liver deaths and suicide had also seen increases, especially in middle-­aged whites, though this had not received the same public attention as the deaths from drug overdoses. Our contribution was to link drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-­related deaths, to note that all w­ ere rising together, that together they ­were afflicting mostly whites, and that, among that group, the long fall in total mortality had ­stopped or reversed. We also chose the collective label “deaths of despair,” which helped publicize the combined epidemic and emphasize that it included more than just drug overdose.
But Something Else Must Be ­Going On
In an early comment on our work, the health economists Ellen Meara and Jonathan Skinner noted that, while it was true that deaths of despair ­were rising rapidly, their combined numbers w­ ere not enough, by

De a t h s of De s pa i r  41
themselves, to account for the flattening or reversal in total mortality.6 Something ­else must be g­ oing on to account for the turnaround in white mortality, in comparison both with twentieth-­century pro­gress and with other groups in the US and other rich countries in the twenty-­ first ­century. We needed to find that “something ­else.”
The remarkable decline in mortality ­after 1970, and the associated increase in life expectancy at birth, was in large part driven by rapid decreases in deaths from heart disease and cancer, the two largest killers in the US. Before age seventy-­five, the risk of ­dying of cancer outpaces that of heart disease; ­after seventy-­five, heart disease takes more victims. ­Because mortality rates are highest at the oldest ages, heart disease is Amer­i­ca’s number one killer. Pro­gress against cancer, the number one killer in midlife, continued apace into the new ­century. The “something ­else” that, together with deaths of despair, halted midlife mortality decline turns out to be a marked slowdown in pro­gress against mortality from heart disease, long an engine of better health and rising life expectancy. That previous pro­gress is usually attributed to ­people quitting smoking—­especially men, who quit ­earlier than ­women, and who are more likely than w­ omen to die from heart disease—­and to more ­people taking preventive drugs for lower blood pressure and cholesterol (antihypertensives and statins). The risk of ­dying of heart disease for US whites ages forty-­five to fifty-­four fell at a brisk pace of 4 ­percent per year on average in the 1980s but decelerated to 2 ­percent per year in the 1990s, 1 ­percent per year in the 2000s, and began to rise ­after 2010.7
Figure 3.1 shows deaths from heart disease for whites ages forty-­five to fifty-­four in the United States, together with Britain and other English-­ speaking countries—­Canada, Australia, and Ireland. ­After 1990, and as we would expect from continuing pro­gress in reducing smoking and the spread of preventive medicine—­whose treatments are readily available in all rich countries—­mortality rates declined and became much more similar across countries. The exception is Amer­ic­ a, which once again has parted com­pany with its neighbors. Indeed, the slowdown in pro­gress against heart disease accounts for a substantial part of the “coming apart” in figure 2.1. Fifteen ­percent of the six hundred thousand extra deaths we

estimated for forty-­five-­to-­fifty-­four-­year-­old whites in chapter 2 come from this source, and not just deaths of despair.
Pro­gress against heart disease was robust u­ ntil 2010 in the rest of the English-­speaking world. However, that pro­gress ended abruptly ­after 2011. This pattern, of steady pro­gress through 2010 followed by mortality rates flatlining, is also true for blacks and Hispanics in the US. This puts the English-­speaking world at odds with the rest of the rich world, where the risk of ­dying from heart disease in midlife continues to fall. Perhaps in the English-­speaking world the improvements from prevention are ­running out, or perhaps as many p­ eople have quit smoking as are ever ­going to. But this cannot explain the poor per­for­mance of heart disease mortality in the United States, which was high by international standards in 1990, so that ­there o­ ught to have been more room for improvement, not less.
When we look at drug overdoses or suicides, the classification of cause of death points to the immediate cause. But heart disease comes in many forms and has many under­lying ­causes, so it is much harder to pin down

De a t h s of De s pa i r  43
the why of figure 3.1. One possibility is that the drugs and alcohol associated with deaths of despair may make ­people more likely to die of heart disease. While moderate drinking (one drink per day for w­ omen, two for men) is thought to increase “good” cholesterol (HDL) and reduce the effects of “bad” cholesterol (LDL), heavy drinking over the long term can lead to heart disease by increasing the risk of high blood pressure and by weakening the heart muscle. Binge drinking (three or more drinks in a one-­to-­two-h­ our period) can make the heart beat irregularly. The relationship between drug abuse and heart disease is more complicated, given that dif­fer­ent drugs have dif­fer­ent effects on the central ner­vous system. Methamphetamines and cocaine (dubbed “the perfect heart attack drug”) are stimulants that increase blood pressure and heart rate, increasing the risk of both heart attack and sudden cardiac death. Less is known about the heart risks associated with opioid abuse. Recent research suggests links between long-­acting opioids and cardiovascular death, but much work h­ ere remains to be done.8 To the extent that heart failure or a fatal heart attack was the result of long-t­ erm alcohol or drug abuse, ­these deaths could also be classified as deaths of despair.
More general threats to heart health in midlife appear to lie in smoking, hypertension, and obesity. While American smoking rates have fallen overall in the past twenty years, in some areas of the country rates remain stubbornly high (this is particularly true of the East South-­Central census division—­Mississippi, Kentucky, Alabama, and Tennessee), and within some demographic groups, smoking rates have continued to increase (true of middle-a­ ged white ­women without a bachelor’s degree). ­There has also been some recent reduction in adherence to antihypertensive medicines.
By far the most popu­lar story for heart disease deaths is obesity, that Americans weigh too much, that they are among the heaviest in the world, and that the prolonged increase in obesity, which many scholars have long predicted ­will undermine health pro­gress, is now actually ­doing so. Many studies have documented the risks of obesity, which include heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. The link from obesity to diabetes is particularly strong, and deaths from diabetes may often be recorded as deaths from heart disease when it is also pre­sent.9 Eating too much,

44  c h a p t e r 3
like drinking too much, is for some p­ eople a reaction to stress and a way of self-­soothing in the face of life’s difficulties and disappointments, so deaths associated with obesity could perhaps also be included as deaths of despair.
We do not take that route ­here, in part ­because it is so difficult to calculate which of the deaths from heart disease are related to overeating. But the obesity explanation is far from complete. The obesity gloom-­ mongers have been crying wolf for a long time and w­ ere predicting that life expectancy would start falling long before t­ here was any sign of it.10 It is also pos­si­ble that the risks associated with obesity ­were lower in recent years and are lower now than when the studies of risk w­ ere done; studies have to follow ­people for many years and, with the arrival of new procedures and drugs, they always run the risk of being out of date before they are completed. Since one of the ways that obesity increases the risk of heart disease is through high blood pressure, the increased availability and use of antihypertensives may have made it safer to be heavy than it used to be.
Comparisons across countries also leave many questions unanswered on the role of obesity. In ­England and Australia, the rise in obesity for adults aged forty-­five to fifty-­four was nearly identical to that seen for whites in the US between the mid-1990s and 2010,11 during which time heart disease mortality in the UK and Australia fell on average at 4 ­percent per year. The synchronized halt to pro­gress in heart disease for US blacks and Hispanics and middle-­aged adults in other English-­speaking countries a­ fter 2011 leaves open the question of ­whether some additional ­factor is now also at work.
What­ever its ultimate cause, the unique pattern of heart disease mortality for US whites combined with the unique pattern of deaths of despair to generate a rise in white midlife mortality ­after 1998. We can think of what happened to overall mortality as the result of a tug-­of-w­ ar. On one side, we have pro­gress against heart disease, pulling mortality rates down. On the other, we have deaths of despair tugging, weakly at first, to pull mortality rates up. In 1990, heart disease pro­gress was “winning,” and overall mortality fell. But, over time, heart disease pro­gress lost its

De a t h s of De s pa i r  45
strength, while deaths of despair grew stronger and overall mortality ­stopped declining and in some midlife groups began to rise.
This account is impor­tant for our story ­here, ­because both the level of heart disease mortality and the slowdown in pro­gress against it vary with age, so the tug-­of-­war for the direction of all-­cause mortality is dif­ fer­ent in dif­fer­ent age-­groups. For whites in their late twenties or early thirties, heart disease is not a big killer, and the rapid increase in deaths of despair has been driving up all-­cause mortality in this part of adulthood for the past twenty years. For whites in their late thirties and early forties, declines in heart disease and cancer and increases in deaths of despair came to a standstill ­until 2013, when access to an even more deadly opioid (fentanyl) began to accelerate deaths from drug overdose. For ­those in their fifties, the complete collapse in pro­gress against heart disease, pitted against rising mortality from drugs, alcohol, and suicide, has been driving up all-­cause mortality since the start of the new ­century.
Not Just in Midlife: Deaths of Despair among Younger Americans
We are telling the story in the way that we uncovered it, starting with midlife deaths of all kinds. We then focused on the immediate c­ auses, which turned out to be deaths of despair among whites plus a slowdown and reversal in deaths from heart disease, which, u­ ntil then, had been a main engine of mortality decline. Unfortunately, deaths of despair are not only afflicting middle-­aged whites. While the el­derly have been largely exempt, t­here have also been rapid increases in deaths of despair—­ particularly from overdoses and suicides—­among younger whites. For whites between the ages of forty-­five and fifty-­four, deaths of despair tripled from 1990 to 2017. In 2017, this midlife age-­group had the highest rate of mortality from deaths of despair. But whites in younger age-­groups ­were also ­doing badly and their deaths ­rose even more rapidly, accelerating in the last few years.

46  c h a p t e r 3
As we write, the epidemic is worsening. In the next chapter, we s­ hall suggest a story of the epidemic in which, with the passage of time, each age-­group does progressively worse than the same age-­group did in e­ arlier years. All the while, the pattern we see in midlife deaths is moving into old age. In 2005, deaths of despair started to increase beyond m­ iddle age.
Parents should not have to watch their grown c­ hildren die. It is a reversal of the normal order of ­things; c­ hildren are supposed to bury their parents, not the reverse. The death of a child, even an adult child, can tear families apart, and the loss of ­people in their prime, ­people who should not be ­dying, upends communities and workplaces too. At the outset of this chapter, we saw how Mr. Manning killed himself in the face of his son “­doing drugs,” and ­there are millions of American ­mothers and ­fathers ­today who are living in dread that the phone call to their adult son or ­daughter ­will go unanswered, or that a phone call ­will come from the police or the emergency room.

The Lives and Deaths of the More (and Less) Educated
in the state of kentucky, where Becky Manning and Marcy Conner told the stories of their husbands’ suicides, the risk of ­dying in midlife from suicide, accidental drug overdose, or alcoholic liver disease was a third higher than the national average in 2017. But not all Kentuckians w­ ere at equal risk. The risk of ­dying a death of despair had risen markedly, but only for t­ hose who did not hold a four-­year college degree. Figure 4.1 shows mortality rates over time from deaths of despair for whites aged forty-­five to fifty-­four in Kentucky. Without a bachelor’s degree, the risk ­rose from 37 to 137 per 100,000 ­people between 1995 and 2015, while that for t­ hose who hold a bachelor’s degree changed ­little.
Kentucky is among the states with relatively low educational attainment, and only a quarter of whites ages forty-­five to fifty-­four hold a bachelor’s degree. But this pattern, of rapidly increasing risk for t­ hose without a four-­year degree, is repeated in all US states. Education is clearly one of the keys to understanding who is ­dying and why. The march of death from arteries and lungs to minds, livers, and veins is largely confined to ­those who have not been to college. If we are to understand the extra risk borne by ­those without a bachelor’s degree, we need to understand the role education plays in ­people’s lives.

What Education Does to Life
In 2017, almost 40 ­percent of the American population aged twenty-­five or older had no more than a high school diploma, 27 ­percent had some tertiary education but did not hold a bachelor’s degree, and 33 ­percent held a four-­year bachelor’s degree or higher qualification. The proportions in each education category changed dramatically for Americans born between 1925 and 1945; 10 ­percent of adults ages twenty to twenty-­ four w­ ere enrolled in school in the late 1940s, doubling to 20 ­percent by the late 1960s.1 Since then, tertiary education has nosed up slowly; the fraction holding a bachelor’s degree increased from a quarter of p­ eople born in 1945 to a third of t­hose born in 1970. For t­hose born a­ fter 1970, and graduating a­ fter 1990, the fraction earning a bachelor’s degree has changed ­little.
The most obvious advantage of having gone to college is that you earn more, and with more money, you can live a better life. In the late 1970s,

T h e Mor e (a n d L e s s) E duc at e d  51
­those with a bachelor’s degree or more earned on average 40 ­percent more than workers who left school with a high school diploma. But by 2000, that “earnings premium,” as economists call it, had doubled, to an astronomical 80 ­percent.2 In contrast, over that period, the earnings premium for Americans with some college education short of a ­bachelor’s degree remained relatively flat, with earnings 15 to 20 ­percent higher than for ­those with a high school degree. ­Those who graduated from high school in the early 1970s and who de­cided not to go to college could not have known how much they would be giving up by the end of the c­ entury.
Many occupations that previously did not require a bachelor’s degree now do, so that the opportunities for ­those who do not go to college are shrinking just as the opportunities for t­ hose who have been to college are expanding. In 2017, at a time when the unemployment rate was only 3.6 ­percent, a historical low, the unemployment rate was almost twice as high among ­those with a high school diploma as it was among t­ hose with a bachelor’s degree. Eighty-­four ­percent of Americans ages twenty-­five to sixty-­four with a bachelor’s degree or higher ­were employed in 2017, while only 68 ­percent of t­ hose with a high school diploma but no additional education ­were employed.3 American workers’ earnings generally peak between the ages of forty-­five and fifty-­four. It is worrying that fully a quarter of Americans in that age-­ group who left school with a high school diploma w­ ere not in the ­labor force in 2017 compared with only 10 ­percent of t­hose with at least a bachelor’s degree.
As we s­ hall see, t­here is much controversy about the why of the difference, w­ hether less educated p­ eople simply do not want to work, at least at the wages that are available to them, or do want to but cannot b­ ecause work is unavailable or ­because they are disabled. What­ever the answer, the fact remains that the l­abor market is delivering for t­ hose with more education in a way that it is not for ­those with less.
As business and government have a­ dopted ever more sophisticated technologies and as their use of computers has increased significantly, the demand for higher skills and higher ability has expanded, which can

52  c h a p t e r 4
explain part of the earnings and employment gap between ­those with less and more education. For the fortunate and talented few at the top, who become hedge fund traders, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, CEOs, or top ­lawyers or doctors, the earnings possibilities are virtually unlimited, much more so than used to be the case. Among Amer­i­ca’s 350 largest firms, average CEO earnings in 2018 was $17.2 million, 278 times average earnings. In 1965 the ratio was only 20 to 1.4 If we go back a hundred years, t­ hose who earned the very highest incomes derived them from capital; they ­were the inheritors of fortunes from the past. Among ­those who lived off interest and dividends, it was a badge of shame to have to work for a living. ­There was no greater disgrace than to have one’s d­ aughter marry a manufacturer. ­Today, the highest incomes are coming not from inherited wealth but rather from high earnings—­for example, for CEOs—or from the profits of self-­employed and highly skilled business proprietors such as con­sul­tants, doctors, and ­lawyers. Education is a required gateway for such jobs, not ­family or birth.5
­People tend to marry p­ eople with similar interests and backgrounds. ­Women with college degrees are more likely to marry college-­educated men. Where once college-­educated ­women stayed at home, in the last part of the twentieth c­ entury they came out to work. As a result, during the period when the ­labor market returns to a college degree ­rose, and more high-­paying professional positions opened to w­ omen, we began to see more ­couples in which both partners had high, professional earnings. A bachelor’s degree or beyond was a ticket not just to a high-­paying job but also to a marriage with two high salaries.
The worlds of the more and less educated have split apart, a divergence that we w­ ill see over and over in this book.6 At work, companies are ­today more likely to be segregated by education, and as we s­ hall see ­later, firms are outsourcing many low-­skill jobs that used to be done in-­house, where ­people with dif­fer­ent levels of education worked together and w­ ere part of the same comp­ any. The more and less educated are now more segregated in where they live, the successful in places where h­ ouse prices are high and to which the less successful do not have access. Greater geo­graph­i­cal segregation has widened the gap in the

T h e Mor e (a n d L e s s) E duc a t e d  53
quality of schools attended by the ­children of the more and less educated. The power ­couples have less time to participate in community activities, other than with their ­children’s schools, so that the more and less educated are less likely to know each other, to understand each other’s concerns, or to participate in common social activities. The tastes of the two groups are dif­fer­ent; they eat in dif­fer­ent kinds of restaurants, visit dif­fer­ent websites, watch dif­fer­ent tele­vi­sion channels, get their news from dif­fer­ent sources, worship in dif­fer­ent kinds of churches, and read dif­fer­ent books. And, as we s­ hall see l­ater, their attachment to the institution of marriage is dif­fer­ent and increasingly so. More educated p­ eople marry l­ater, they are more likely to stay married, they have ­children much l­ater, and they are less likely to have ­children out of wedlock.
Gallup asks a large sample of Americans to rate their lives on a “ladder of life” from 0 (“the worst pos­si­ble life you can imagine”) to 10 (“the best pos­si­ble life you can imagine”). From 2008 to 2017, more than 2.5 million ­people answered this question, and their average life evaluation was 6.9. For t­ hose with a bachelor’s degree or above, the average was 7.3, compared with 6.6 for t­hose with a high school diploma or less. About half of this ladder-­of-­life advantage comes from the higher incomes that the more educated enjoy, leaving a very substantial advantage attributable to education itself, or at least to the nonincome benefits that education brings. Gallup also asks ­people about ­whether they get to do something in­ter­est­ing or something they like ­every day; once again, the educated have a huge advantage.7
Education and Meritocracy
A more educated society is dif­fer­ent in ways that go beyond the differences between individuals. At least to some extent, every­one benefits from the innovations and higher productivity of more educated ­people. Better equality of opportunity is a worthy goal, and every­one approves of opening educational opportunities to bright ­children who ­were previously excluded on grounds of their ­family, income, or birth. Meritocracy is a

54  c h a p t e r 4
touchstone virtue of our age, and no one doubts the benefits of allowing every­one a chance to succeed and to rise to the level of their abilities. Indeed, it is clear that we need more of it in some areas. An excellent example is who becomes an inventor; inventions are key to economic growth and ­future prosperity. ­Children born in the top 1 ­percent of the income distribution are ten times more likely to become inventors than ­those in the bottom half of the income distribution. This failure of meritocracy is leaving “lost Einsteins” who might have changed the world for the better.8
Meritocracy has its downsides too, which w­ ere recognized by the British economist and sociologist Michael Young, who in 1958 in­ven­ ted the term meritocracy and who predicted a social disaster as a result of its rise.9
Indeed, we have already seen one prob­lem, that some jobs that w­ ere once open to nongraduates are now reserved for t­hose with a college degree. If the jobs—­such as t­ hose in law enforcement, for example—a­ re better done by ­those with a degree, that is a good t­ hing, in and of itself. But if ­there are resources that are in fixed supply, such as nice places to live and work, they ­will be allocated away from ­those with less education. Most seriously, and this is what concerned Young, the loss of the smartest ­children from the less educated group deprives them of talent that is useful to the group itself. Young writes that “the bargaining over the distribution of national expenditure is a b­ attle of wits, and that ­defeat was bound to go to ­those who lost their clever ­children to the ­enemy.” He notes that the real reason the elites have been so relatively successful is that “the ­humble no longer have anyone—­except ­themselves—to speak for them.” When talented ­people lack a chance to move up, they miss the opportunity to shine and to benefit ­others in the wider world in which they become able to work, but the movement of talent also denudes the places and groups from where they came. Young refers to the less educated group as “the populists,” and the elite as “the hy­poc­risy.”10
Writing sixty years ­later, about our own times, the po­liti­cal phi­los­o­ pher Michael Sandel discusses the corrosive effects of meritocracy: “Winners are encouraged to consider their success their own ­doing, a

T h e Mor e (a n d L e s s) E duc at e d  55
mea­sure of their virtue—­and to look down upon ­those less fortunate than themselves. ­Those who lose out may complain that the system is rigged, that the winners have cheated and manipulated their way to the top. Or they may harbor the demoralizing thought that their failure is their own ­doing, that they simply lack the talent and drive to succeed.”11 According to a 2019 poll, only half of American adults think that colleges are having a positive effect on the country; 59 ­percent of Republicans—­the party that has increasingly become the party of the less educated—­think they are having a negative effect.12
­Because they are selected on ability, not f­amily wealth or position, meritocrats are more able than ­those they have replaced. Again, much of this ­will be personally and socially beneficial. But when a new group succeeds, it does what the previous group once tried to do, which is to entrench their own positions against the next generation of meritocrats. Being more able, they are more successful at the exclusionary and advantage-­seeking strategies on behalf of themselves and their ­children that are privately enriching but socially destructive. The wealthy can pay for more, and higher-­quality, coaching for college entrance exams and essays, as well as for diagnoses of disabilities that allow their c­ hildren extra time for classwork and exams.13
When meritocracies are unequal, as is the case in the US t­ oday, with vast rewards for successfully identified merit—p­ assing exams, promotions, making partner, speculating successfully, or getting elected—­the rewards are paid not only for ability and virtue but also for cheating and for abandoning long-­held ethical constraints that are seen as impediments to success. The saying “If you ­ain’t cheating, you ­ain’t trying” applies beyond sports. An unequal meritocracy is likely to be one in which standards of public be­hav­ior are low, and where some members of the elite are corrupt, or are seen as corrupt by t­hose in the out-­group. An extreme case is the college entrance scandal of 2019, when wealthy parents paid bribes to secure places for their ­children at elite colleges. Our guess is that the rise of the meritocracy in ­today’s vastly unequal Amer­i­ca has contributed to the “winner-­take-­all” and much harsher atmosphere in corporations t­oday.14 Perhaps meritocracies destroy themselves over time.15

Death and Education
That mortality rates are higher in the US for ­people with less education has long been known. One of the ways that education is protective against a preventable disease is when the way the disease works is understood but when that understanding is more accessible to ­those with more education. The demographers Samuel Preston and Michael Haines have shown that at the dawn of the twentieth ­century, before the germ theory of disease had been widely digested, “the ­children of physicians had mortality that was scarcely better than that for the average child, indicating fairly clearly that physicians had few weapons at their disposal to advance survival. By 1924, the mortality of physicians’ ­children was 35 ­percent below the national average. ­Children of teachers advanced as rapidly, and all professionals made g­ reat strides during the period.”16 Moving closer to the pre­sent, smoking rates ­were very similar by education group before the release in 1964 of the surgeon general’s report on the health risks associated with smoking. A­ fter that point, smoking rates began to diverge, with more educated ­people more likely to quit and less likely to start smoking. Of course, this does not explain why smoking rates for the less educated remain higher more than half a ­century ­after the health risks ­were understood. Knowledge is clearly not every­thing. Patterns of health-­related be­hav­iors by social status are frequently found, and status itself may be one of the keys to understanding them.17
Health be­hav­iors continue to vary by education. In 2017, white American adults (twenty-­five and over) with a high school degree or less ­were four times more likely to be current smokers than ­those with a bachelor’s degree or more (29 versus 7 ­percent), while ­those with some college but no degree fell in between (19 ­percent). A third of whites with less than a bachelor’s degree ­were obese in 2015, compared with less than a quarter of t­ hose with a bachelor’s degree, and ­those without a bachelor’s degree have lost ground in successfully controlling hypertension. ­Those with a bachelor’s degree or more are also taller than t­hose without, by about half an inch on average—­a reflection of better childhood health and nutrition.18

­These f­actors contribute to the rapid widening of the mortality gap between whites with and without a bachelor’s degree that we are witnessing ­today. Taken as a w­ hole, white mortality in the age-­group forty-­five to fifty-­four has held constant since the early 1990s. But this masks the fact that for t­ hose with less than a bachelor’s degree, death rates r­ ose by 25 ­percent, while for t­ hose with a bachelor’s degree, mortality dropped by 40 ­percent.19 In 2017, ­those with a bachelor’s degree or more earned twice as much as t­ hose without, which speaks to the advantage of the more educated in life. That their risk of d­ ying in midlife is only a quarter of that seen for ­those without a bachelor’s degree speaks to their advantage in death.
While increases in mortality gaps for heart disease and cancer both contributed to the growing gap in mortality between education groups, it was the rise in deaths of despair among ­those with less than a bachelor’s degree that largely accounts for the widening of the all-­cause mortality gap. Figure 4.2 shows the numbers for the US as a ­whole, separately for men and for w­ omen.

58  c h a p t e r 4
Men and ­women in this age-­group are much less likely to die deaths of despair if they have a bachelor’s degree. A gap between the two groups is apparent for men in 1992. Men with less education w­ ere always more likely to die from alcohol, drugs, or suicide, but the gap widened rapidly as the epidemic progressed, so that by 2017, t­hose in the less educated group ­were three times more likely to succumb to ­these deaths.
In the early 1990s, white w­ omen w­ ere at low risk of d­ ying from alcohol, suicide, or drug overdose, regardless of their education. Early media coverage of our work often carried headlines about “angry” white men ­dying, which we think stemmed from an inability to imagine that w­ omen could kill themselves in ­these ways. Historically, they did not. But that has changed. ­Women are less likely to kill themselves—t­his appears to be true everywhere in the world where we have data, even in China, which used to be an exception—a­ nd they are less likely to die from alcoholic liver disease or from drug overdoses. Yet the graph shows that the epidemic is affecting men and ­women in almost equal numbers. This is true for each component—­ suicide, drug overdose, and alcoholic liver disease—­examined separately. We argue against the view, espoused by some in the media, that this is an epidemic that is more serious for ­women. This plague has not discriminated by sex.20
The Destiny of Birth
Figure 4.3 plots deaths of despair among all adults, not just ­those in midlife. H­ ere we look at ­people with and without a college degree according to their year of birth, tracking birth cohorts through time as they age. It is worth spending time on this figure, b­ ecause it is impor­tant for understanding what has happened, and ­because we ­shall use similar figures in subsequent chapters. The fates of dif­fer­ent Americans depend on when they w­ ere born, when they finished school, and when they started work, and ­these graphs help us to see all of this.

figure 4.3. Alcohol, drug, and suicide mortality, white non-­Hispanics, by birth cohort 1992–2017. Authors’ calculations using Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention data.

The left panel of the figure shows ­people without a bachelor’s degree, while the right panel shows ­people with a bachelor’s degree or more. The left panel is easier to see, though both panels are constructed in exactly the same way. Each line refers to a specific birth “cohort,” or the group of ­people born in a given year, which is marked on the figure; farthest left is the cohort born in 1985, and farthest to the right is the cohort born in 1935. The horizontal axis shows age, and the ­people in each cohort age by twenty-­six years as we follow each cohort through time from 1992 to 2017, which is all that our data allow. In order to make the figures legible, we show only e­ very fifth birth cohort. Each line, or “track,” in the figure shows how the rate of mortality from deaths of despair changed over time as each birth cohort aged.
As we look at younger and younger cohorts of ­those without a college degree, we find that their risk of ­dying a death of despair is higher than the risk for the cohorts that came before. At age forty-­five, for ­those without a bachelor’s degree, the birth cohort of 1960 faced a risk 50 ­percent higher than the cohort born in 1950, and the cohort of 1970 faced a risk more than twice as high. The ­later you ­were born, the higher your risk of ­dying a death of despair at any given age. The risk rises with age for all but the oldest cohorts (­those born in 1935 and 1940). Each successive

60  c h a p t e r 4
cohort ­faces a risk of death that is rising more rapidly with age than that faced by the cohorts that came before.
Remarkably, the right-­hand panel, showing cohorts of ­those who have a bachelor’s degree, is quite dif­f er­ent. In contrast to the sharp differences by cohorts for t­ hose without a college degree, it is difficult to tell the birth cohorts apart. As with the less educated, the risk of a death of despair rises with age, at least u­ ntil age sixty, but each cohort seems to be aging almost along the same trajectory. If we look closely, we can see that t­ here are (much smaller) differences across cohorts and that ­here, too, later-­born cohorts are d­ oing slightly worse. But, in the language of the demographers, ­there are no or only very small “cohort effects”; each cohort is aging along the same profile.
The patterns for black non-­Hispanics across birth cohorts, for both education groups, look very much like that for whites with a bachelor’s degree—­rising with age within an education group, but with very ­little difference between birth cohorts. For blacks, ­there is no progressive deterioration for younger cohorts.
For the cohort of non-­Hispanic whites born in 1935, whom we see in their sixties and seventies in figure 4.3, the difference in the risk of a death of despair between t­hose with and without a bachelor’s degree is only three per one hundred thousand. But the difference between the less and more educated grew dramatically for later-­born cohorts so that, in the cohort born in 1960, whom we see in their forties and fifties, the difference between ­those with and without a bachelor’s degree is ten times larger than that for the cohort of 1935. The catastrophe that has come to less educated whites, and that is getting steadily worse the ­later they ­were born, is affecting the educated in a much less severe way.
­Going back to the nineteenth ­century, and even before Emile Durk­ heim’s foundational study of suicide in 1897, more educated p­ eople ­were more likely to kill themselves.21 The epidemic has reversed that long-­ standing pattern. In the birth cohorts born between 1935 and 1945, suicide was equally common among t­ hose with and without a college degree. However, beginning with cohorts born in the early 1950s, ­those without a bachelor’s degree w­ ere at higher risk. The divergence in the risk

T h e Mor e (a n d L e s s) E duc a t e d  61
of suicide between the less and more educated has grown with each successive birth cohort. For t­ hose born in 1980, whites without a bachelor’s degree are four times more likely to commit suicide than ­those with a four-­year degree. ­These twenty-­first-­century suicides are dif­f er­ent from past suicides; they are happening to dif­f er­ent ­people and, we might reasonably presume, for dif­fer­ent reasons.

Black and White Deaths
in the doonesbury cartoon featuring B. D. and his friend Ray, Ray claims that blacks and Latinos are immune to deaths of despair ­because they are used to distress and deprivation. B. D. ironically refers to this immunity as “black privilege.”1 It is ironic ­because middle-a­ ged blacks are far from privileged in their risk of d­ ying, just as they are far from privileged in many other aspects of life.
Over the past quarter c­ entury, at least up to 2013, African Americans did not suffer the relentless increase in deaths of despair that we have documented among whites. However, e­ arlier in the twentieth c­ entury, blacks faced a mortality crisis precipitated by the arrival of crack cocaine and HIV. This occurred ­after a period of large-­scale job loss for lower-­ skilled black workers. Jobs in manufacturing and transportation left the inner city, which led to social upheaval, detachment from the l­abor force, and a disintegration of f­amily and community life. As we s­ hall see in l­ater chapters, this story has many parallels with what has happened to less educated whites in the last twenty-­five years. When the ­labor market turned against its least skilled workers, blacks w­ ere the first to lose out, in part b­ ecause of their low skill levels, and in part ­because of long-­ standing patterns of discrimination. De­cades ­later, less educated whites, long protected by white privilege, ­were next in line. The debates about ­causes, between lack of opportunity, on the one hand, and lack of virtue, on the other, are also remarkably similar in the two episodes. What happened to blacks and whites differs perhaps more in when than in what.

figure 5.1. Mortality rates for blacks and whites ages 45–54, 1968–2017. Authors’ calculations using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.

We ­will tell this story in more detail, but we start, as usual, with the numbers.
Black and White Mortality: Facts
Figure 5.1 shows mortality rates for blacks and whites since 1968 for the midlife group aged forty-­five to fifty-­four.2 Black mortality rates have fallen more rapidly than t­ hose for whites but have been, and remain, consistently higher. This has been happening since the 1930s, when midlife death rates for blacks ­were an appalling two and a half times higher than for whites.
The black-w­ hite gap has closed, but at dif­fer­ent rates in dif­fer­ent periods. In the late 1960s, when white mortality rates stalled ­because of smoking in ­earlier years, the gap closed quickly. In the 1980s, it was black mortality’s turn to stall; this was when the crack and HIV epidemics fell hard on the black community. We w­ ill come back to this episode.

B l a c k a n d W h i t e De a t h s  65
From 1990, black mortality resumed its pro­gress so that, when white mortality ­stopped falling in the late 1990s, the gap closed rapidly. Reducing the gap is most welcome, but it would have been much more so had it come more from increasingly rapid pro­gress among blacks and less from the stalling of pro­gress among whites. On the far right of the graph, black midlife mortality stops falling and starts rising; we w­ ill return to this too.
One point is obvious but impor­tant. Black mortality rates are higher than white mortality rates throughout the picture. Blacks are ­doing worse than whites. By contrast, black mortality rates have fallen faster than white mortality rates. From this one might say that blacks are “­doing better” than whites even though they are more likely to die. We w­ ill always try to be very clear about w­ hether we are talking about levels of mortality or rates of change (pro­gress) in mortality. More fundamentally, it is the probability of d­ ying that m­ atters to p­ eople, not its rate of change, and in this, white privilege remains. Even with white death rates rising, the difference in levels between white and black mortality remains stark: black mortality rates in 2017 w­ ere only slightly lower than ­those experienced by whites forty years ­earlier.
It is understandable that B. D. would find it strange that ­there should be any health measurement—­either change or level—­that is not worse for blacks. A dispiriting fact is that deprivation in one aspect of life usually comes with deprivation in ­others. Health disparities between groups usually run parallel to social, economic, and educational disparities between ­those groups, and in the US, blacks are more likely to live in poverty, are less likely to hold a college degree, and continue to face discrimination. So it is indeed both unusual and surprising that all-­ cause death rates w­ ere falling for blacks while death rates for white rates ­were increasing.
Blacks and Whites in the Current Epidemic of Deaths of Despair
The main reason why death rates of blacks fell more rapidly than death rates of whites at the beginning of the twenty-­first ­century is that blacks ­were not suffering the epidemic of overdoses, suicide, and alcoholism.

figure 5.2. Drug, alcohol, and suicide mortality in midlife, 1992–2017, blacks and whites, with and without a college degree. Authors’ calculations using Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention data, ages 45–54 (age-­adjusted).

Figure 5.2 shows deaths of despair—­suicide, alcohol, and drug mortality—­for ages forty-­five to fifty-­four, from 1992 to 2017, among whites (black lines) and blacks (gray lines). As we saw in chapter 4, a college degree makes a huge difference to the likelihood of d­ ying, so we show separate lines for both groups.
For blacks, with or without a college degree, midlife mortality rates from deaths of despair ­were flat or falling for a quarter ­century, while white mortality ­rose, particularly for ­those without a college degree. For both blacks and whites, the contrast between ­those with and without a college degree is particularly notable.
The increase in black mortality in the most recent years comes from an interaction between the current opioid epidemic and the ­earlier drug epidemic in the black community. As we ­shall see in chapter 9, the epidemic has most recently been driven by fentanyl, an opioid that is much more power­ful and dangerous than heroin. The e­ arlier drug epidemic among blacks had left a substantial number of long-­term but stably functioning addicts in the black community. But when dealers started

B l ac k a n d W h i t e De a t h s  67
mixing fentanyl with heroin and cocaine, ­those long-­term addicts started ­dying; a customarily safe dose had, without the victim’s knowledge, become a lethal cocktail. From the low point of black mortality from all ­causes (in 2014), increases in death rates involving synthetic narcotics (like fentanyl) can fully account for the increase in mortality observed for t­hose aged forty-­five to fifty-­four. Half of the increase in deaths involved a mix of synthetic narcotics with heroin, and half with cocaine. In addition, as discussed in chapter 2, the fall in deaths from heart disease came to an end, possibly connected with the drug deaths. ­Until ­these events, the current epidemic was a white epidemic.
Drug overdoses and alcohol-­related liver mortality caused many deaths among blacks in the ­earlier epidemic, and among whites in the current one. But in deaths from suicide, the parallel breaks down. African Americans are much less likely to kill themselves than are white Americans; their suicide rates in midlife have changed l­ittle in the past fifty years and are currently about a quarter of t­hose for whites. The ratio is not fixed and differs by age, but the much lower rate for blacks has long been the case and was noted as early as 1897 by Emile Durkheim in his foundational book on suicide.3 ­There is no widely accepted explanation for the difference. George Simpson, in his introduction to an En­glish translation of Durkheim’s book, summarizes Durkheim’s view that perhaps “systematic oppression and underprivilege lead individuals to be adjusted to the misery and tragedy of ­human existence which is visited upon us all.” 4 He also notes something e­ lse that remains relevant t­ oday: the lower suicide rate of blacks shows that underprivilege alone is not a cause of suicide.
African American Despair
What happened to inner-­city African Americans ­after midcentury is, we ­shall argue, a foreshadowing of our account of whites in the twenty-­first ­century. The e­ arlier story is told by the eminent sociologist William Julius Wilson in his 1987 book The Truly Disadvantaged.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, African Americans in inner cities ­were employed in old-­economy industries in manufacturing and

68  c h a p t e r 5
transportation. With the beginnings of postwar foreign competition, the switch from manufacturing to ser­vices, and the evolution of cities from centers of manufacturing to centers of administration and information pro­cessing, African Americans ­were hurt in the areas in which they had made the most pro­gress. It is a tale of job loss and of social disintegration; according to Wilson, blacks who lived in the cities ­were predominantly employed where they w­ ere “vulnerable to structural economic changes, such as the shift from goods-p­ roducing to service-­ producing industries, the increasing polarization of the ­labor market into low-­wage and high-­wage sectors, technological innovations, and the relocation of manufacturing industries out of the central cities.”5 In the face of ­these transformations, and the passage of fair-­housing legislation, the more educated and successful African Americans moved out of the inner cities, leaving ­behind neighborhoods that increasingly displayed a range of social pathologies, including deterioration of the black ­family, and ultimately crime and vio­lence.
­Women who conceived out of wedlock gave birth out of wedlock for lack of marriageable (i.e., employed) partners. As ­earlier predicted by Michael Young, the communities ­were denuded of the most talented and most successful, who moved out of the inner city. For blacks in the 1960s, the passage of civil rights legislation helped this to happen. Communities that had had a mix of professionals and manual workers, of more and less educated ­people, became increasingly deprived not only of successful and educated ­people but also of ­those in any kind of employment, with negative consequences for the community, and especially for young men. Wilson attributes the prob­lems faced by the inner-­city black community to “the large scale and harmful changes in the l­abor market, and its resulting spatial concentration as well as the isolation of such areas from the more affluent parts of the black community.”6 Writing about the parallel t­oday, the economist Raghuram Rajan notes that talented and well-­educated young p­ eople have headed to the growing, successful, high-­ tech towns and cities.7
African American inner-­city communities faced a crisis of crack cocaine in the 1980s. The crack epidemic shows both contrasts and parallels with the current opioid epidemic. Crack was cheap and offered an

Bl ac k a n d W h i t e De at h s  69
immediate high that was highly addictive. Crime rates increased, as t­ hose addicted looked for money for their next fix. As crack dealers fought for a place on a street corner, hom­i­cide rates among young black men spiked. While crack is still available and remains a scourge, the epidemic largely burned itself out by the mid-1990s. The reasons for its subsidence are still debated, but the aging of the population that had turned to crack as well as disgust among a younger generation that saw crack ruin the lives of ­family members and friends both appear to have played a role. Recent research indicates that crack continues to cast a long shadow, having permanently increased the number of guns available in the inner city.8 And as we have seen, the hangover of addiction from the epidemic has led to rising mortality from fentanyl.
Epidemics usually have c­ auses that extend beyond the proximate ­causes, be it the availability of crack cocaine in inner cities in the 1980s or the increased availability of prescription opioids in predominantly white communities a­ fter the mid-1990s. A fundamental force in both cases was the long-t­erm loss of working-­class jobs, for blacks in northern cities in the 1970s and for less educated whites across much of the country more recently. With globalization, changing technology, rising healthcare costs of employees, and the shift from manufacturing to ser­ vices, firms shed less educated l­abor, first blacks and then less educated whites.
In both epidemics, drugs that could ease psychological or physical pain ­were available at an (arguably) affordable price to populations that ­were hungry for the escape that they seemed to offer. During the crack epidemic, the inner city offered few legitimate ave­nues of pro­gress. In the opioid crisis, it is less educated whites, many of whom do not see a promising economic ­future, or a promising ­future in any aspect of their lives, who are falling prey to drugs, alcohol, and suicide. We should also not exaggerate the similarities, especially when we are comparing blacks and whites t­ oday. Deaths of despair include suicides, and ­these differ markedly by race.
The misfortunes of African Americans in the 1970s and 1980s ­were widely attributed to a failure of black culture. Daniel Patrick Moynihan was a Harvard sociology professor, a longtime Democ­ ratic senator

70  c h a p t e r 5
representing New York from 1977 to 2001, and an adviser to both the Johnson and Nixon administrations. In 1965 he wrote a famous report, The Negro ­Family,9 in which he identified families without f­athers as a central prob­lem of African American communities and traced its roots back to slavery. The idea that the fundamental malady was not lack of opportunity was taken up by the po­liti­cal scientist Charles Murray in Losing Ground, which also argued that welfare benefits designed to combat poverty w­ ere undermining work and helping create the dysfunctional be­hav­ior. Murray’s l­ ater book, Coming Apart, attributes many of the current prob­lems of less educated whites to their own failures of virtue, particularly a failure of industriousness, meaning that they are no longer interested in working for a living or in supporting their families.10
In chapter 11, we look at the ­labor market and ­will show that Murray’s thesis cannot explain what has happened recently for less educated whites. If p­ eople are withdrawing their ­labor, wages should rise; but in the late part of the twentieth ­century and into the twenty-­first, wages fell along with employment, a clear indication that the prob­lem lies with falling demand, not falling supply. As to the e­ arlier episode, we endorse Wilson’s view that “conservative assertions about underclass life and be­ hav­ior ­were weakened ­because of a lack of direct evidence and ­because they seemed to be circular in the sense that cultural values ­were inferred from the be­hav­ior of the underclass to be explained, and then t­ hese values ­were used as the explanation of the be­hav­ior.”11

The Health of the Living
in anna karenina, Leo Tolstoy famously claims that for a ­family, ­there is only one way of being happy, but many dif­fer­ent ways of being unhappy. We rather doubt the truth of this, but it certainly applies to death and sickness—­you are ­either dead or alive, but ­there are many dif­ fer­ent ways of being sick. Sickness in its many forms compromises your ability to lead a life that is good for you; in the words of the economist and phi­los­o­pher Amartya Sen, it reduces your capabilities.1 We explore several mea­sures of ill health in this chapter, and we w­ ill see that all of them show that ill health is increasing in midlife, just as deaths have risen. Not only are ­people ­dying, but their lives are becoming less worth living. Sickness is part of the despair in deaths of despair.
It is not inevitable that sickness and death should go up together. Although it is true that ­people at risk of death—­for example, from alcoholism or from cancer—­are in poor health before they die, t­here is no necessary connection between a population’s health, what is sometimes called its nonfatal health, and its mortality rate. If it is the sickest ­people who die off, higher death rates can even lift the average health of ­those who are left. A new treatment may save many lives but leave many with a chronic but not fatal disease; antiretroviral therapy for HIV is an example.
This chapter looks at health among the living. The numbers are not pretty, especially for the less educated. As mortality rates have risen among midlife whites, indicators of health among ­those who are not ­dying are getting worse. Fewer ­people think that their health is very good
71

72  c h a p t e r 6
or excellent. More p­ eople are experiencing pain, serious m­ ental distress, and difficulty ­going about their day-­to-­day lives. ­People report that their health is making it harder for them to work. Not being able to work reduces income, which can lead to other deprivations and hardships, and work is itself a source of satisfaction and meaning for many ­people. Not being able to spend time with friends, go out for a meal, go to a ballgame, or just hang out all shrink and impoverish lives. As is the case for deaths, worsening health seems to be singling out t­ hose of working age with less education.
Mea­sur­ing Health among the Living
The World Health Organ­ization defines health as “a state of complete physical, m­ ental, and social wellbeing, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”2 Taking this broad view suggests many indicators to look at, both positive, such as aspects of flourishing, and negative, such as indicators of sickness. The technical term for ill health while alive is morbidity, in contrast to mortality, which refers to death. ­There are many ways of being sick, each with its own indicator. Some are meas­ ured at an annual physical examination. Samples of blood and urine give indicators of cholesterol, diabetes, and heart, kidney, and liver function. Your physician or another medical professional ­will also meas­ ure the four “vital signs”: blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, and rate of respiration. In recent years, it has become common for physicians to ask about pain, sometimes called the fifth vital sign, a topic to which we ­will return.
­There are also indicators of health that you know without professional assistance: w­ hether you are overweight; ­whether and how much you smoke and drink; how you are feeling in general, both physically and emotionally; which activities you can manage and which you cannot, including ­whether you are able to work; ­whether you sometimes or regularly experience pain and, if so, how severe it is. A good physician ­will also ask about ­mental health and about your social and emotional life. Losing a job, a friend, or a spouse can bring intense emotional pain. Good physicians also understand that pain can often exist without ­there being an injury, that pain without an injury cannot be dismissed as “all

T h e H e a lt h of t h e L i v i ng  73
in your head,” and that ­there is no bright line between emotional and physical pain.
It makes no sense to try to come up with a single comprehensive indicator of health—­for example, to say that you are 73 ­percent healthy. Unlike being e­ ither alive or dead, a s­ imple black-­and-w­ hite distinction, health and morbidity have too many dimensions to allow any ­simple, uncontroversial meas­ ure. Some meas­ ures are inevitably “softer” than ­others; think of blood pressure or pulse rate, on the one hand, versus general feelings of health or of how life is ­going, on the other. Self-­reports are often all that we have; life evaluation or pain is what p­ eople say it is, not what a medical professional says it is. T­ here are no experts on how your life is ­going, or ­whether your world is circumscribed by pain. To neglect what p­ eople feel is a ­mistake, even if it is a ­mistake that the practice of medicine (and the economics profession) has made for much of its history.
When someone dies, the death and all of its details must be recorded on an official death certificate, and it is from t­ hose that we got the information on the mortality rates that we looked at in previous chapters. Such recording of vital statistics is standard in rich countries around the world. But when you go to the doctor for your physical, or with a medical issue, the results are not centrally recorded, so t­here is no national register of obesity, hypertension, or cholesterol, just to give some examples. For ­people treated u­ nder Medicare, medical rec­ords are centrally stored, but ­these rec­ords are short of information on the characteristics of the patients, so while they tell us a lot about conditions, treatments, and costs, they are much less informative about the personal attributes of ­those being treated. In some Scandinavian countries that have government-­provided healthcare, all encounters are recorded, and ­those data can be linked, at least in princip­ le, with other data about individuals—­ for example, about their education, marital history, income, and taxes.
In the US we rely on surveys that sample h­ ouse­holds or individuals, mostly run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though ­there are impor­tant private surveys too. The largest of t­ hese is the Behavioral Risk F­ actor Surveillance System (BRFSS),3 a state-­based telephone survey coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and

74  c h a p t e r 6
Prevention in which p­ eople are asked to report health-­related information. The BRFSS (affectionately pronounced “burr-­fuss”) obtains information from around four hundred thousand adults ­every year, asking them to rate their health, to report conditions such as pain, and to report be­hav­iors that affect health—­risk ­factors—­such as smoking, drinking, height and weight, and exercise.
We also report numbers from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS),4 which visits around thirty-­five thousand ­house­holds annually, interviewing one adult in depth and collecting information on all other ­house­hold members. ­These surveys also ask ­people about their contacts with the medical system—­for example, ­whether a medical professional has ever told them that they have cancer, high blood pressure, or heart disease. ­Those reports are useful, but they depend not just on the prevalence of conditions but also on the extent to which p­ eople visit clinics and on how aggressive clinics are in diagnostic testing. For example, ­there has been a large increase in diagnoses of thyroid cancer in recent years but no change in the mortality rate from the disease, suggesting that ­actual prevalence has increased much less than has the extent of testing. Many diagnostic tests are quite profitable for providers, and overtesting (and subsequent overtreatment) is always a possibility. For our purposes ­here, if overtesting is dif­f er­ent in dif­f er­ent places, geographic or national patterns ­will be distorted.
­Because the BRFSS and the NHIS are nationally representative and are run ­every year, we can use them to compare answers over time and look for signs that health and health be­hav­iors are improving or deteriorating. Surveys on the scale of the BRFSS or the NHIS are expensive to run and rely on respondents’ reports about their health, rather than on the results of physical examinations and lab tests, which are often conducted in surveys run on a much smaller scale, in specially designed mobile centers.5 ­These smaller surveys collect blood, for example, as well as height, weight, and blood pressure meas­ ured by medical professionals, rather than self-­reports. Perhaps not surprisingly, ­people systematically misreport their heights and weights; many ­people shrink ­after age fifty, but they remember and report their height as young adults, recollecting better days, though this is more often true for men than w­ omen.

T h e H e a lt h of t h e L i v i ng  75
­Women, by contrast, tend to underreport their weights.6 One can hardly begrudge ­people a ­little imaginary self-­improvement, though it is good to know the truth for scientific purposes. Medical professionals often discount self-­reports of height by el­derly men—­including one of us—­and profess surprise when the claim is accurate. Examination surveys not only allow the collection of information about health that p­ eople cannot know themselves, but they also allow a cross-­check on information from larger, less expensive, and less invasive interviews.
The Condition of the Living: What ­People Say about Their Health
The simplest of all health questions asks ­people to rate their own health in five categories: excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. It is easy to pick holes in questions like this. Perhaps dif­fer­ent ­people mean dif­fer­ent ­things by “excellent” or “very good”—p­ erhaps some are tough and feel wonderful in circumstances that would flatten the rest of us. The answers are undoubtedly affected by personal and social expectations about health—in poor countries, the poorest often say that they are in better health than the rich ­because they cannot afford to admit that their health is too poor to allow them to work.7 Is my health “good”? Relative to what? In spite of all of this, the answers tend to match up with other meas­ ures, including objectively verifiable meas­ ures, and, perhaps surprisingly, they pick up health-­relevant information over and above what a physician gleans from a full physical examination.8 ­These reports contain real information, although it is good to verify it when pos­si­ble, which gives us some confidence when verification is impossible.
Figure 6.1 shows, from the BRFSS, the fraction of the white, non-­ Hispanic population who report that their health is fair or poor (which we ­will refer to as “poor” health). Each line traces out that fraction, between ages twenty-­five and seventy-­five, for a par­tic­u­lar year. Given the importance of education as a dividing line for deaths of despair, we pre­ sent t­ hese self-­reports of health separately for t­ hose without a four-­year degree, in the left panel, and ­those with a bachelor’s degree or more, in

Reports of poor health rise with age, for both education groups; with age, life is more likely to deliver aches and pains and chronic conditions that interfere with good health. Indeed, if reports of poor health did not rise with age, we would reject self-­reports as a useful meas­ ure of health. Even so, the rise tells us that ­people are not simply judging their health relative to other p­ eople their own age—if that w­ ere the case, the lines would be flat; on average, ­people are as healthy as the average of other ­people their own age.
The fractions reporting poor health are markedly dif­f er­ent by education. In 1993, for example, at age forty, t­ hose without a bachelor’s degree ­were almost three times more likely to report poor health than ­those with a four-­year degree (8 ­percent versus 3 ­percent). But the big story in this figure is how the lines for t­ hose without a bachelor’s degree have changed over time. (We have results for the other years in between, but we omit them to make the picture clear.) Younger p­ eople without a four-­year degree—­those from age twenty-­five to around age fifty or fifty-­five in the left panel—­report worse health as time goes on. At age forty, the percentage reporting poor health doubled between 1993 and 2017 (from 8 to 16 ­percent). For t­hose with a college degree, ­there was a small increase

T h e H e a lt h of t h e L i v i ng  77
in reports of poor health, but as was true for deaths of despair, their changes are dwarfed by ­those for ­people with less education.
Over the same period, older whites, aged sixty or over, w­ ere reporting better health, with a smaller and smaller fraction saying that their health was fair or poor. By 2017, for t­hose without a bachelor’s degree, adults above age sixty w­ ere reporting better health than w­ ere ­those in their late fifties. This puzzling result comes from presenting dif­fer­ent birth cohorts in the same figure. Among t­ hose without a bachelor’s degree, later-­born birth cohorts are reporting worse health at each age than did the cohorts that came before them, which gives rise to the anomalous-­ looking result.
That the increase in poor health between survey years holds only for ­those without a bachelor’s degree speaks against ­there having been a ­simple change in how birth cohorts assess their health, with later-­born cohorts being more sensitive, say, to pain or chronic conditions, leading them to report worse health. If that ­were true, we would expect to see the same change for ­those with a four-­year college degree. Not at all coincidentally, the changing age-h­ ealth profile for ­those without a college degree matches the changing patterns of mortality discussed in chapter 2, with improvements among the el­derly and deterioration in midlife. And as was true for deaths of despair, the reporting of poorer health started at least as far back as the early 1990s and gathered strength slowly, well before the financial crisis of 2008. What has happened to mortality is happening to morbidity; more midlife whites are ­dying, and t­ hose who are not ­dying are reporting worse health.9
The Condition of the Living: Other Mea­sures
The increase in reports of poor health in midlife among less educated whites, presented in figure 6.1, can be seen in other health meas­ ures too; the graphs differ from meas­ ure to mea­sure, but the fact that bad t­ hings are happening in midlife, especially to t­ hose without a bachelor’s degree, applies to a lot of “­things.” One particularly impor­tant example is m­ ental health, mea­sured ­here using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. Since 1997, respondents in the NHIS have been asked a series of six

questions about their feelings over the last month, which are compounded into a score based on how often they experienced each feeling. When that score crosses a threshold, the respondent is classed as experiencing serious m­ ental distress. The questions cover how often respondents felt sad, ner­vous, restless, hopeless, worthless, and that “every­thing was an effort,” all feelings that might contribute to despair. Figure 6.2 shows the relationship of ­mental distress and age over the period 1997 to 2017 for ­those without a bachelor’s degree, in the left panel, and for ­those with a bachelor’s degree, in the right panel, for respondents ages twenty-­five to seventy-­five. In each panel, the vertical axis is the fraction of respondents in serious ­mental distress according to this scale.
For t­ hose without a degree, the risk of severe ­mental distress is highest in midlife, peaking between ages forty and sixty, the ages at which the stresses of work, raising c­ hildren, and caring for eld­ erly parents may all be pressing. In the late 1990s, severe m­ ental distress was less common among young adults and the el­derly, although over the past twenty years it has grown as much for young adults as it has for ­those in ­middle age. Again, the upward trend has been slow and steady, and it does not appear to have accelerated during the G­ reat Recession in response to economic difficulties. Around age fifty, the percentage of whites without a

T h e H e a lt h of t h e L i v i ng  79
bachelor’s degree in severe m­ ental distress ­rose from 4 to 6 ­percent from 1997–2000 to 2014–17.
As was true of deaths of despair, the picture looks very dif­fer­ent for ­those with a four-­year college degree, presented in the right panel of figure 6.2. The risk of severe ­mental distress in this group is also highest for adults in their m­ iddle years, but the risk is only a quarter of that faced by t­ hose without a bachelor’s degree. Among young adults with a four-­year degree, t­ here has been an increase in severe m­ ental distress, but it pales in comparison to that faced by t­ hose without a bachelor’s degree.
Other meas­ ures also indicate that health is worsening for t­ hose with less education. In the next chapter, we ­shall show that the same is true for pain, which plays a particularly impor­tant role in this book. But ­there is more. Whites in midlife are having a harder time just ­going about their usual activities, which health surveys mea­sure as difficulties with “instrumental activities of daily living.” Since 1997, the NHIS has asked adults how difficult they would find it to walk a quarter of a mile (about three city blocks), climb ten steps, stand or sit for two hours, go out to do t­ hings like shop or go to the movies, relax at home, and socialize with friends. An ever-­growing fraction of working-­age whites without a four-­year degree report “more than a ­little” difficulty in each of ­these activities—­ something that has not happened to whites with a bachelor’s degree, and something that has not happened to older adults (ages sixty-­five to seventy-­four). The fraction of whites without a bachelor’s degree who express difficulty in ­going out to do ­things like shop or go to the movies and the fraction finding it hard to relax at home have increased by 50 ­percent for t­ hose aged twenty-­five to fifty-­four, and the fraction finding it difficult to socialize with friends has nearly doubled in this twenty-­ year period. The inability to socialize with friends not only removes one of life’s most pleas­ur­able and impor­tant activities but also puts ­people at risk for suicide.
Rising obesity may play a part ­here. Carrying around extra weight can make it more difficult to enjoy activities of daily living, especially when ­people are not young. Obesity is often meas­ ured by the body mass index (BMI). BMI is defined as weight in kilos (1 kilo is 2.2 pounds) divided

80  c h a p t e r 6
by the square of height mea­sured in meters (1 meter is 39.4 inches). It is a “pounds per square inch” kind of meas­ ure, but done on a metric scale. You are officially “obese” if your BMI is above 30, and underweight if your BMI is less than 18.5. (One of us is beyond obese and one is on the cusp of being underweight, so we know what we are talking about.) Yet the increase in American obesity cannot explain the deterioration in ­these health indicators for the s­ imple reason that we see similar deteriorations at all levels of BMI—a­ mong the underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese. Midlife Americans are not getting sicker just b­ ecause they are getting fatter.
One meas­ ure that is not getting worse is the fraction of ­people who are smoking. For white non-­Hispanics aged twenty-­five to sixty-­four, smoking rates have continued to fall, though they remain much higher for ­those without a bachelor’s degree. The only group where smoking rates increased steadily from 1993 through 2017 is ­women aged forty-­five to fifty-­four without a university degree; even h­ ere the increase is small, 2 or 3 percentage points. We find it surprising that, overall, smoking rates have fallen for t­ hose without a four-­year degree while mortality rates from drugs, alcohol, and suicide have been rising; one of us is an ex-­smoker, and smoking used to soothe in much the same way that alcohol can, though perhaps not as much as the combination. It is also worth noting that the prevalence of tobacco use in the US is a good deal lower than in many other rich countries.
Ability to Work
Being sick makes life worse, in and of itself, but it also interferes with other activities that are ­either directly valuable, such as socializing with friends, or both directly and instrumentally valuable, such as being able to work. Note that not being able to work is dif­fer­ent from reporting being out of work, which rises and falls with the state of the economy. In contrast, the share of whites of working age reporting that they are unable to work has risen steadily since at least the early 1990s. As is true for self-­reports of physical and ­mental health, shown in figures 6.1 and 6.2, ­there are dramatic differences ­here by education. For ­those aged forty-­five to

T h e H e a lt h of t h e L i v i ng  81
fifty-­four, historically the peak earning years, the percentage of whites reporting that they ­were unable to work ­rose from 4 ­percent in 1993 to 13 ­percent in 2017 for t­ hose without a bachelor’s degree. The percentage for ­those with a four-­year degree was initially low and remained so, between 1 and 2 p­ ercent.
Some of ­those who are unable to work are eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits from the state. Eligibility depends on the number of years a worker has paid into the Social Security system, the nature of the worker’s disability, and ­whether the worker is capable of performing a job in which his or her disability is not a barrier to work. For the discussion ­here, a concern is that the disability system may entice ­people to report being unable to work so as to escape work and live off the l­abor of every­one ­else.10 It is certainly pos­si­ble that some of the mea­sures in this chapter are corrupted by such shading of the truth. If you are actually not disabled but have managed to claim disability, then it might be wise, when the survey statisticians ask, to remember that you are receiving disability payments ­because you are unable to work, and report so to the surveyors.
It is hard to be sure that the reports are not being distorted by the existence of the disability support system, but we suspect not by much.11 The deterioration in health indicators is too uniform across too many dif­ fer­ent meas­ ures, as we have seen h­ ere and w­ ill see again in the next chapter, on pain. In addition, reports of being unable to work have grown for ­those who are not eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits, t­ hose who do not have work histories to qualify. Most impor­ tant of all is the concordance between the upsurge in morbidity of all kinds and the epidemic of death. Perhaps p­ eople feign illness to claim benefits, but the fact that they are d­ ying is surely evidence that something real is ­going on.
In Summary
We have told a story in which death and sickness go together. Something is making life worse, especially for less educated whites. Crucial capabilities that make life worth living are being compromised, including the

82  c h a p t e r 6
ability to work and the ability to enjoy life with o­ thers. Severe m­ ental distress is on the rise. Of course, many more ­people are experiencing this deterioration in the quality of life than are d­ ying, but the deterioration is surely the background to the deaths. In the next chapter, we turn to another kind of morbidity, pain, which turns out to be a link between social disintegration and deaths of despair.

The Misery and Mystery of Pain
In a time when kingdoms come Joy is brief as summer’s fun Happiness, its race has run Then pain stalks in to plunder.
—­m aya a nge l ou
pain has a special place in our narrative. Social and community distress, the ­labor market, politics, and corporate interests all collide around pain, and pain is one of the channels through which each of them affects deaths of despair.
In our search for the story b­ ehind the deaths, pain kept coming up, in apparently dif­fer­ent contexts. Pain is an impor­tant risk f­actor for suicide; the victim believes that the intolerable pain ­will never get better. The treatment of pain is a root of the opioid epidemic. The brain’s natur­al opioid system controls both euphoria and pain relief. P­ eople use the language of pain and hurt to describe “social pain,” from rejection, exclusion, or loss, and ­there is evidence that social pain uses some of the same neural pro­ cesses that signal physical pain, from stubbing a toe or cutting a fin­ger, or from arthritis. Tylenol can reduce social pain as well as physical pain. Americans are reporting more pain, especially less educated Americans.1
­These connections are consistent with the account that we have come to ­favor, which is that the increase in pain among less educated Americans can be traced back to the slow disintegration of their social and
83

84  c h a p t e r 7
economic lives, and that the pain is, in turn, one of the links through which disintegration leads to suicide and addiction. The story of a death of despair often passes through pain.
Pain in Amer­i­ca
­Every year, more Americans report that they are in pain. The largest increases are in midlife among ­those who do not have a college degree. Albert Schweitzer wrote that pain “is a more terrible lord of mankind than even death himself.” The lives of many millions of Americans are compromised by pain; some cannot work, some cannot spend time with friends or loved ones in the way that they would like, some cannot sleep, and some cannot do the activities that make daily life pos­si­ble and fulfilling. Pain can undermine appetite, induce fatigue, and inhibit healing; in extreme cases, it erodes the ­will to live.
Aging, even healthy aging, brings more aches and pains; arthritis is the most familiar but not the only cause. Even so, in Amer­i­ca t­oday, pain in midlife has grown so rapidly that we have the unusual situation that the middle-­aged are actually reporting more pain than the eld­ erly. ­People are experiencing pain from many ­causes and from no discernible cause at all. According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, more than one hundred million Americans suffer from chronic pain, defined as pain that has lasted for at least three months.2 Much of this chronic pain does not appear to be a response to an originating injury or cause that could be treated to eliminate the pain, and many health professionals now treat chronic pain as a disease in and of itself, even if it remains poorly understood and poorly treated. The long-h­ eld understanding of pain as a signal to the brain to deal with an injury has been discarded and replaced by the recognition that the mind is involved in all pain and that social distress or empathetic distress can engender pain in the same way as the distress from a physical injury.3 One useful definition of pain is that it is “what­ever the experiencing person says it is, existing whenever s/he says it does.” 4 The patient is the only authority, not the physician or scientist.
The prevalence of pain varies by occupation, and ­people who work in manual occupations are more likely to be injured or to experience pain

T h e M i s e r y a n d M y s t e r y of Pa i n  85
than t­ hose of us who work b­ ehind a desk or in front of a computer screen. They are also more likely to develop painful conditions as they age; their bodies wear down more rapidly.5 For this and for other reasons, pain is more common and increases more rapidly with age among ­those with less education. Indeed, the very word ­labor is often synonymous with pain, as in ­labor pains or Adam’s punishment and humankind’s condemnation to painful toil in the book of Genesis. The words pain and penalty come from the same Latin root.
Causation runs from pain to work as well as from work to pain. ­People in pain may be unable to work and may make claims on disability insurance; some may doubt t­hose claims, which has long generated l­egal, po­litic­ al, and academic ­battles over the real­ity of pain. We have devices to mea­sure body temperature or blood pressure, but none that can assign a number to pain, perhaps with a cutoff that is generally accepted as disabling. It is often useful to imagine what would happen if ­there w­ ere such a device, an “afflictometer” perhaps, with implanted sensors and a dial on the forehead, that could provide an accurate assessment of overall pain. As it is, a definition that pain is “what­ever the experiencing person says it is” poses obvious prob­lems for disability policy.
­Those who are in the business of treating pain—­such as the phar­ma­ ceut­i­cal companies who manufacture painkillers—h­ ave goals of their own that do not always align with the best interests of t­ hose who are experiencing pain. Pharma companies have made many billions of dollars from selling drugs to combat pain even as reports of pain have risen with the number of prescriptions written. They are interested in selling their products, and in persuading governments to make it as easy as pos­si­ble for them to do so. The be­hav­ior of corporations, and how they might be regulated to act in the public interest, is also part of the story of pain.
Pain Facts
Gallup regularly collects data from a large sample of Americans. One of the questions that it asks is w­ hether the respondent experienced physical pain during a lot of the day “yesterday,” meaning in the day before the survey. We look at the geography of pain in Amer­i­ca using small

areas—­counties, when a county’s population is large enough; other­ wise, collections of adjacent counties. ­There are more than three thousand counties in the US, some of which are mostly mountains and trees. We aggregate t­hese up to about one thousand small areas, each with at least one hundred thousand p­ eople. Figure 7.1 shows the pain map of the United States for white non-­Hispanics ages twenty-­five to sixty-­four, averaged over 2008 to 2017, with darker colors showing areas where a larger fraction of ­people report such pain.6
Across the thousand areas, the fraction of ­people reporting pain yesterday (from the Gallup data) is strongly associated with suicides, and with deaths of despair more generally. One key takeaway is the distribution of pain across the country, with the West, Appalachia, the South, Maine, and northern Michigan ­doing badly, and with much less pain reported in the North Central Plains as well as along the I-95/Amtrak corridor in the Northeast and the Bay Area in California; again, pain tends to be lower in places where the population is more highly educated. The fraction of p­ eople reporting pain is higher in areas with higher

unemployment rates and more poverty.7 The fraction of p­ eople in an area who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 is also strongly correlated with the fraction in pain.
Figure 7.2 uses the same data to plot the fraction who reported pain among the 1.8 million whites aged twenty-­five to eighty who answered the question between 2008 and 2017. The solid line shows the fraction of all whites in pain; it rises from 17 ­percent at age twenty-­five to a peak of 30 ­percent at age sixty, before falling and leveling out at 27 ­percent at age eighty. Note that the graph is not following the same p­ eople as they age; the ­people on the right (in their sixties and seventies) are dif­fer­ent ­people from ­those on the left (in their twenties and thirties).
­There is something very odd about this line. Age normally brings pain, and although some manage to stay perpetually young, average pain levels inevitably increase with age. For ­people in manual occupations, the onset of pain with age is often faster—t­hink of the package-­delivery worker whose back is eventually hurt by all the lifting, or the worker in mining or in agriculture who is constantly at risk of injury.
