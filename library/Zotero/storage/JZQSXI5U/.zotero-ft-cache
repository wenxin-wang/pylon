PROLOGUE.
Considering how many fools can calculate, it is surprising that it should be thought either a difficult or a tedious task for any other fool to learn how to master the same tricks.
Some calculus-tricks are quite easy. Some are enormously difficult. The fools who write the textbooks of advanced mathematics—and they are mostly clever fools—seldom take the trouble to show you how easy the easy calculations are. On the contrary, they seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way.
Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. What one fool can do, another can.

CHAPTER I.
TO DELIVER YOU FROM THE PRELIMINARY TERRORS.
The preliminary terror, which chokes off most fifth-form boys from even attempting to learn how to calculate, can be abolished once for all by simply stating what is the meaning—in common-sense terms—of the two principal symbols that are used in calculating.
These dreadful symbols are: (1) d which merely means “a little bit of.” Thus dx means a little bit of x; or du means a little bit of u. Ordinary mathematicians think it more polite to say “an element of,” instead of “a little bit of.” Just as you please. But you will find that these little bits (or elements) may be considered to be indefinitely small. (2) which is merely a long S, and may be called (if you like) “the sum of.” Thus dx means the sum of all the little bits of x; or dt means the sum of all the little bits of t. Ordinary mathematicians call this symbol “the integral of.” Now any fool can see that if x is considered as made up of a lot of little bits, each of which is called dx, if you add them all up together you get the sum of all the dx’s, (which is the

CALCULUS MADE EASY

2

same thing as the whole of x). The word “integral” simply means “the whole.” If you think of the duration of time for one hour, you may (if you like) think of it as cut up into 3600 little bits called seconds. The whole of the 3600 little bits added up together make one hour.
When you see an expression that begins with this terrifying symbol, you will henceforth know that it is put there merely to give you instructions that you are now to perform the operation (if you can) of totalling up all the little bits that are indicated by the symbols that follow.
That’s all.

CHAPTER II.
ON DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SMALLNESS.
We shall find that in our processes of calculation we have to deal with small quantities of various degrees of smallness.
We shall have also to learn under what circumstances we may consider small quantities to be so minute that we may omit them from consideration. Everything depends upon relative minuteness.
Before we fix any rules let us think of some familiar cases. There are 60 minutes in the hour, 24 hours in the day, 7 days in the week. There are therefore 1440 minutes in the day and 10080 minutes in the week.
Obviously 1 minute is a very small quantity of time compared with a whole week. Indeed, our forefathers considered it small as compared with an hour, and called it “one minu`te,” meaning a minute fraction—namely one sixtieth—of an hour. When they came to require still smaller subdivisions of time, they divided each minute into 60 still smaller parts, which, in Queen Elizabeth’s days, they called “second minu`tes” (i.e. small quantities of the second order of minuteness). Nowadays we call these small quantities of the second order of smallness “seconds.” But few people know why they are so called.
Now if one minute is so small as compared with a whole day, how

CALCULUS MADE EASY

4

much smaller by comparison is one second!

Again, think of a farthing as compared with a sovereign: it is barely

worth

more

than

1 1000

part.

A

farthing

more

or

less

is

of

precious

little

importance compared with a sovereign: it may certainly be regarded

as a small quantity. But compare a farthing with £1000: relatively to

this

greater

sum,

the

farthing

is

of

no

more

importance

than

1 1000

of

a

farthing would be to a sovereign. Even a golden sovereign is relatively

a negligible quantity in the wealth of a millionaire.

Now if we fix upon any numerical fraction as constituting the pro-

portion which for any purpose we call relatively small, we can easily

state other fractions of a higher degree of smallness. Thus if, for the

purpose

of

time,

1 60

be

called

a

small

fraction,

then

1 60

of

1 60

(being

a

small fraction of a small fraction) may be regarded as a small quantity

of the second order of smallness.*

Or,

if

for

any

purpose

we

were

to

take

1

per

cent.

(i.e.

1 100

)

as

a

small

fraction,

then

1

per

cent.

of

1

per

cent.

(i.e.

1 10,000

)

would

be

a

small

fraction

of

the

second

order

of

smallness;

and

1 1,000,000

would

be

a small fraction of the third order of smallness, being 1 per cent. of

1 per cent. of 1 per cent.

Lastly, suppose that for some very precise purpose we should regard

1 1,000,000

as

“small.”

Thus, if a first-rate chronometer is not to lose

or gain more than half a minute in a year, it must keep time with

an accuracy of 1 part in 1, 051, 200. Now if, for such a purpose, we

*The mathematicians talk about the second order of “magnitude” (i.e. greatness) when they really mean second order of smallness. This is very confusing to beginners.

DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SMALLNESS

regard

1 1,000,000

(or

one

millionth)

as

a

small

quantity,

then

1 1,000,000

of

1 1,000,000

,

that

is

1 1,000,000,000,000

(or

one

billionth)

will

be

a

small

quantity

of the second order of smallness, and may be utterly disregarded, by

comparison.

Then we see that the smaller a small quantity itself is, the more

negligible does the corresponding small quantity of the second order

become. Hence we know that in all cases we are justified in neglecting

the small quantities of the second—or third (or higher)—orders, if only

we take the small quantity of the first order small enough in itself.

But, it must be remembered, that small quantities if they occur in

our expressions as factors multiplied by some other factor, may become

important if the other factor is itself large. Even a farthing becomes

important if only it is multiplied by a few hundred.

Now in the calculus we write dx for a little bit of x. These things

such as dx, and du, and dy, are called “differentials,” the differential

of x, or of u, or of y, as the case may be. [You read them as dee-eks,

or dee-you, or dee-wy.] If dx be a small bit of x, and relatively small of

itself, it does not follow that such quantities as x · dx, or x2 dx, or ax dx

are negligible. But dx × dx would be negligible, being a small quantity

of the second order.

A very simple example will serve as illustration.

Let us think of x as a quantity that can grow by a small amount so

as to become x + dx, where dx is the small increment added by growth.

The square of this is x2 + 2x · dx + (dx)2. The second term is not

negligible because it is a first-order quantity; while the third term is of

the second order of smallness, being a bit of, a bit of x2. Thus if we

CALCULUS MADE EASY

6

took

dx

to

mean

numerically,

say,

1 60

of

x,

then

the

second

term

would

be

2 60

of

x2,

whereas

the

third

term

would

be

1 3600

of

x2.

This

last

term

is clearly less important than the second. But if we go further and take

dx

to

mean

only

1 1000

of

x,

then

the

second

term

will

be

2 1000

of

x2,

while

the

third

term

will

be

only

1 1,000,000

of

x2.

x

Fig. 1.

Geometrically this may be depicted as follows: Draw a square

(Fig. 1) the side of which we will take to represent x. Now suppose

the square to grow by having a bit dx added to its size each way.

The enlarged square is made up of the original square x2, the two

rectangles at the top and on the right, each of which is of area x · dx

(or together 2x · dx), and the little square at the top right-hand corner

which is (dx)2. In Fig. 2 we have taken dx as quite a big fraction

of

x—about

1 5

.

But

suppose

we

had

taken

it

only

1 100

—about

the

thickness of an inked line drawn with a fine pen. Then the little corner

square

will

have

an

area

of

only

1 10,000

of

x2,

and

be

practically

invisible.

Clearly (dx)2 is negligible if only we consider the increment dx to be

itself small enough.

Let us consider a simile.

Suppose a millionaire were to say to his secretary: next week I will

give you a small fraction of any money that comes in to me. Suppose

that the secretary were to say to his boy: I will give you a small fraction

of what I get.

Suppose the

fraction in each case to be

1 100

part.

Now

if Mr. Millionaire received during the next week £1000, the secretary

would receive £10 and the boy 2 shillings. Ten pounds would be a

small quantity compared with £1000; but two shillings is a small small

quantity indeed, of a very secondary order. But what would be the

would get only £1, and the boy less than one farthing!

“So, Nat’ralists observe, a Flea “Hath smaller Fleas that on him prey. “And these have smaller Fleas to bite ’em, “And so proceed ad infinitum.”
An ox might worry about a flea of ordinary size—a small creature of the first order of smallness. But he would probably not trouble himself about a flea’s flea; being of the second order of smallness, it would be negligible. Even a gross of fleas’ fleas would not be of much account to the ox.

CHAPTER III.
ON RELATIVE GROWINGS.
All through the calculus we are dealing with quantities that are growing, and with rates of growth. We classify all quantities into two classes: constants and variables. Those which we regard as of fixed value, and call constants, we generally denote algebraically by letters from the beginning of the alphabet, such as a, b, or c; while those which we consider as capable of growing, or (as mathematicians say) of “varying,” we denote by letters from the end of the alphabet, such as x, y, z, u, v, w, or sometimes t.
Moreover, we are usually dealing with more than one variable at once, and thinking of the way in which one variable depends on the other: for instance, we think of the way in which the height reached by a projectile depends on the time of attaining that height. Or we are asked to consider a rectangle of given area, and to enquire how any increase in the length of it will compel a corresponding decrease in the breadth of it. Or we think of the way in which any variation in the slope of a ladder will cause the height that it reaches, to vary.
Suppose we have got two such variables that depend one on the other. An alteration in one will bring about an alteration in the other, because of this dependence. Let us call one of the variables x, and the

CALCULUS MADE EASY

10

other that depends on it y. Suppose we make x to vary, that is to say, we either alter it or
imagine it to be altered, by adding to it a bit which we call dx. We are thus causing x to become x + dx. Then, because x has been altered, y will have altered also, and will have become y + dy. Here the bit dy may be in some cases positive, in others negative; and it won’t (except by a miracle) be the same size as dx.
Take two examples. (1) Let x and y be respectively the base and the height of a rightangled triangle (Fig. 4), of which the slope of the other side is fixed

at 30◦. If we suppose this triangle to expand and yet keep its angles

the same as at first, then, when the base grows so as to become x + dx,

the height becomes y + dy. Here, increasing x results in an increase

of y. The little triangle, the height of which is dy, and the base of which

is dx, is similar to the original triangle; and it is obvious that the value

of the ratio dy is the same as that of the ratio y . As the angle is 30◦

it will be seen that here

dy dx

(2) Let x represent, in Fig. 5, the horizontal distance, from a wall, of the bottom end of a ladder, AB, of fixed length; and let y be the

height it reaches up the wall. Now y clearly depends on x. It is easy to see that, if we pull the bottom end A a bit further from the wall, the top end B will come down a little lower. Let us state this in scientific language. If we increase x to x + dx, then y will become y − dy; that is, when x receives a positive increment, the increment which results to y is negative.
Yes, but how much? Suppose the ladder was so long that when the bottom end A was 19 inches from the wall the top end B reached just 15 feet from the ground. Now, if you were to pull the bottom end out 1 inch more, how much would the top end come down? Put it all into inches: x = 19 inches, y = 180 inches. Now the increment of x which we call dx, is 1 inch: or x + dx = 20 inches.

CALCULUS MADE EASY

12

How much will y be diminished? The new height will be y − dy. If we work out the height by Euclid I. 47, then we shall be able to find how much dy will be. The length of the ladder is

(180)2 + (19)2 = 181 inches.

Clearly then, the new height, which is y − dy, will be such that

(y − dy)2 = (181)2 − (20)2 = 32761 − 400 = 32361, √
y − dy = 32361 = 179.89 inches.

Now y is 180, so that dy is 180 − 179.89 = 0.11 inch. So we see that making dx an increase of 1 inch has resulted in
making dy a decrease of 0.11 inch. And the ratio of dy to dx may be stated thus:

dy dx

=

−

0.11 1

.

It is also easy to see that (except in one particular position) dy will be of a different size from dx.

Now right through the differential calculus we are hunting, hunting, hunting for a curious thing, a mere ratio, namely, the proportion which dy bears to dx when both of them are indefinitely small.
It should be noted here that we can only find this ratio dy when dx
y and x are related to each other in some way, so that whenever x varies y does vary also. For instance, in the first example just taken, if the base x of the triangle be made longer, the height y of the triangle

becomes greater also, and in the second example, if the distance x of the foot of the ladder from the wall be made to increase, the height y

ON RELATIVE GROWINGS

13

reached by the ladder decreases in a corresponding manner, slowly at

first, but more and more rapidly as x becomes greater. In these cases

the relation between x and y is perfectly definite, it can be expressed mathematically, being y = tan 30◦ and x2 + y2 = l2 (where l is the
x length of the ladder) respectively, and dy has the meaning we found in
dx each case.

If, while x is, as before, the distance of the foot of the ladder from

the wall, y is, instead of the height reached, the horizontal length of

the wall, or the number of bricks in it, or the number of years since it

was built, any change in x would naturally cause no change whatever in y; in this case dy has no meaning whatever, and it is not possible
dx to find an expression for it. Whenever we use differentials dx, dy,

dz, etc., the existence of some kind of relation between x, y, z, etc., is

implied, and this relation is called a “function” in x, y, z, etc.; the two expressions given above, for instance, namely y = tan 30◦ and x2 +y2 =
x l2, are functions of x and y. Such expressions contain implicitly (that

is, contain without distinctly showing it) the means of expressing either

x in terms of y or y in terms of x, and for this reason they are called

implicit functions in x and y; they can be respectively put into the

forms

y = x tan 30◦ √

or

y x = tan 30◦

and

y = l2 − x2 or x = l2 − y2.

These last expressions state explicitly (that is, distinctly) the value of x in terms of y, or of y in terms of x, and they are for this reason called explicit functions of x or y. For example x2 + 3 = 2y − 7 is an

14

function

in

x

and √

y;

it

may

be

written

y

=

x2 + 10 2

(explicit

function of x) or x = 2y − 10 (explicit function of y). We see that

an explicit function in x, y, z, etc., is simply something the value of

which changes when x, y, z, etc., are changing, either one at the time

or several together. Because of this, the value of the explicit function

is called the dependent variable, as it depends on the value of the other

variable quantities in the function; these other variables are called the

independent variables because their value is not determined from the

value assumed by the function. For example, if u = x2 sin θ, x and θ

are the independent variables, and u is the dependent variable.

Sometimes the exact relation between several quantities x, y, z ei-

ther is not known or it is not convenient to state it; it is only known,

or convenient to state, that there is some sort of relation between these

variables, so that one cannot alter either x or y or z singly without

affecting the other quantities; the existence of a function in x, y, z

is then indicated by the notation F (x, y, z) (implicit function) or by

x = F (y, z), y = F (x, z) or z = F (x, y) (explicit function). Sometimes

the letter f or ϕ is used instead of F , so that y = F (x), y = f (x) and

y = ϕ(x) all mean the same thing, namely, that the value of y depends

on the value of x in some way which is not stated. We call the ratio dy “the differential coefficient of y with respect dx
to x.” It is a solemn scientific name for this very simple thing. But

we are not going to be frightened by solemn names, when the things

themselves are so easy. Instead of being frightened we will simply pro-

nounce a brief curse on the stupidity of giving long crack-jaw names;

and, having relieved our minds, will go on to the simple thing itself,

ON RELATIVE GROWINGS

15

namely the ratio dy . dx
In ordinary algebra which you learned at school, you were always

hunting after some unknown quantity which you called x or y; or some-

times there were two unknown quantities to be hunted for simultane-

ously. You have now to learn to go hunting in a new way; the fox being

now neither x nor y. Instead of this you have to hunt for this curious

cub called dy . The process of finding the value of dy is called “dif-

dx

dx

ferentiating.” But, remember, what is wanted is the value of this ratio

when both dy and dx are themselves indefinitely small. The true value

of the differential coefficient is that to which it approximates in the

limiting case when each of them is considered as infinitesimally minute. Let us now learn how to go in quest of dy . dx

NOTE TO CHAPTER III.

How to read Differentials.

It will never do to fall into the schoolboy error of thinking that dx means d times x, for d is not a factor—it means “an element of” or “a bit of” whatever follows. One reads dx thus: “dee-eks.”
In case the reader has no one to guide him in such matters it may here be simply said that one reads differential coefficients in the following way. The differential coefficient

dy is read “dee-wy by dee-eks,” or “dee-wy over dee-eks.” dx

So also

du is read “dee-you by dee-tee.” dt

Second differential coefficients will be met with later on. They are like this:

d2y dx2

;

which

is

read

“dee-two-wy

over

dee-eks-squared,”

and it means that the operation of differentiating y with respect to x has been (or has to be) performed twice over.
Another way of indicating that a function has been differentiated is by putting an accent to the symbol of the function. Thus if y = F (x), which means that y is some unspecified function of x (see p. 13), we may write F ′(x) instead of d F (x) . Similarly, F ′′(x) will mean that the
dx original function F (x) has been differentiated twice over with respect to x.

CHAPTER IV.
SIMPLEST CASES.
Now let us see how, on first principles, we can differentiate some simple algebraical expression.
Case 1. Let us begin with the simple expression y = x2. Now remember that the fundamental notion about the calculus is the idea of growing. Mathematicians call it varying. Now as y and x2 are equal to one another, it is clear that if x grows, x2 will also grow. And if x2 grows, then y will also grow. What we have got to find out is the proportion between the growing of y and the growing of x. In other words our task is to find out the ratio between dy and dx, or, in brief, to find the value of dy . dx Let x, then, grow a little bit bigger and become x + dx; similarly, y will grow a bit bigger and will become y+dy. Then, clearly, it will still be true that the enlarged y will be equal to the square of the enlarged x. Writing this down, we have:
y + dy = (x + dx)2.

CALCULUS MADE EASY

18

Doing the squaring we get: y + dy = x2 + 2x · dx + (dx)2.

What does (dx)2 mean? Remember that dx meant a bit—a little bit—of x. Then (dx)2 will mean a little bit of a little bit of x; that is, as explained above (p. 4), it is a small quantity of the second order of smallness. It may therefore be discarded as quite inconsiderable in comparison with the other terms. Leaving it out, we then have:
y + dy = x2 + 2x · dx.
Now y = x2; so let us subtract this from the equation and we have left

dy = 2x · dx.

Dividing across by dx, we find
dy = 2x. dx Now this* is what we set out to find. The ratio of the growing of y to the growing of x is, in the case before us, found to be 2x.

*N.B.—This

ratio

dy dx

is the

result of

differentiating

y

with respect

to x.

Dif-

ferentiating means finding the differential coefficient. Suppose we had some other

function of x, as, for example, u = 7x2 + 3. Then if we were told to differentiate this

with

respect

to

x,

we

should

have

to

find

du dx

,

or,

what

the

thing,

On the other hand, we may have a case in which time was the independent variable

(see

as

this:

Numerical example.

Suppose x = 100 and ∴ y = 10, 000. Then let x grow till it becomes

101 (that is, let dx = 1). Then the enlarged y will be 101 × 101 =

10, 201. But if we agree that we may ignore small quantities of the

second order, 1 may be rejected as compared with 10, 000; so we may

round off the enlarged y to 10, 200. y has grown from 10, 000 to 10, 200;

the bit added on is dy, which is therefore 200.

dy dx

=

200 1

= 200.

According

to

the

algebra-working

of

the

previous

paragraph, we find dy = 2x. And so it is; for x = 100 and 2x = 200.

dx

But, you will say, we neglected a whole unit.

Well, try again, making dx a still smaller bit.

Try

dx

=

1 10

.

Then

x + dx

=

100.1,

and

(x + dx)2 = 100.1 × 100.1 = 10, 020.01.

Now the last figure 1 is only one-millionth part of the 10, 000, and

is utterly negligible; so we may take 10, 020 without the little decimal

at the end.

And this makes dy = 20; and

dy dx

=

20 0.1

= 200, which is

still the same as 2x.

Case 2. Try differentiating y = x3 in the same way. We let y grow to y + dy, while x grows to x + dx. Then we have
y + dy = (x + dx)3.

Doing the cubing we obtain y + dy = x3 + 3x2 · dx + 3x(dx)2 + (dx)3.

CALCULUS MADE EASY

20

Now we know that we may neglect small quantities of the second and third orders; since, when dy and dx are both made indefinitely small, (dx)2 and (dx)3 will become indefinitely smaller by comparison. So, regarding them as negligible, we have left:

y + dy = x3 + 3x2 · dx.

But y = x3; and, subtracting this, we have:

dy = 3x2 · dx,

and

dy = 3x2.

dx

Case 3. Try differentiating y = x4. Starting as before by letting both y and x grow a bit, we have:

y + dy = (x + dx)4.

Working out the raising to the fourth power, we get

y + dy = x4 + 4x3 dx + 6x2(dx)2 + 4x(dx)3 + (dx)4.
Then striking out the terms containing all the higher powers of dx, as being negligible by comparison, we have

y + dy = x4 + 4x3 dx.

Subtracting the original y = x4, we have left

dy = 4x3 dx,

and

dy = 4x3.

dx

Now all these cases are quite easy. Let us collect the results to see if we can infer any general rule. Put them in two columns, the values of y in one and the corresponding values found for dy in the other: thus
dx
dy y
dx x2 2x x3 3x2 x4 4x3
Just look at these results: the operation of differentiating appears to have had the effect of diminishing the power of x by 1 (for example in the last case reducing x4 to x3), and at the same time multiplying by a number (the same number in fact which originally appeared as the power). Now, when you have once seen this, you might easily conjecture how the others will run. You would expect that differentiating x5 would give 5x4, or differentiating x6 would give 6x5. If you hesitate, try one of these, and see whether the conjecture comes right.
Try y = x5.

Then

y + dy = (x + dx)5 = x5 + 5x4 dx + 10x3(dx)2 + 10x2(dx)3 + 5x(dx)4 + (dx)5.

Neglecting all the terms containing small quantities of the higher orders, we have left

y + dy = x5 + 5x4 dx,

CALCULUS MADE EASY

22

and subtracting whence

y = x5 leaves us dy = 5x4 dx, dy = 5x4, exactly as we supposed. dx

Following out logically our observation, we should conclude that if we want to deal with any higher power,—call it n—we could tackle it in the same way.

Let

y = xn,

then, we should expect to find that
dy = nx(n−1). dx For example, let n = 8, then y = x8; and differentiating it would give dy = 8x7. dx And, indeed, the rule that differentiating xn gives as the result nxn−1 is true for all cases where n is a whole number and positive. [Expanding (x + dx)n by the binomial theorem will at once show this.] But the question whether it is true for cases where n has negative or fractional values requires further consideration.
Case of a negative power. Let y = x−2. Then proceed as before:

y + dy = (x + dx)−2

So, neglecting the small quantities of higher orders of smallness, we have:

y + dy = x−2 − 2x−3 · dx.

Subtracting the original y = x−2, we find

dy = −2x−3dx, dy = −2x−3. dx And this is still in accordance with the rule inferred above.

CHAPTER V.

NEXT STAGE. WHAT TO DO WITH CONSTANTS.
In our equations we have regarded x as growing, and as a result of x being made to grow y also changed its value and grew. We usually think of x as a quantity that we can vary; and, regarding the variation of x as a sort of cause, we consider the resulting variation of y as an effect. In other words, we regard the value of y as depending on that of x. Both x and y are variables, but x is the one that we operate upon, and y is the “dependent variable.” In all the preceding chapter we have been trying to find out rules for the proportion which the dependent variation in y bears to the variation independently made in x.
Our next step is to find out what effect on the process of differentiating is caused by the presence of constants, that is, of numbers which don’t change when x or y change their values.
Added Constants. Let us begin with some simple case of an added constant, thus:

Let

y = x3 + 5.

Just as before, let us suppose x to grow to x+dx and y to grow to y+dy.

CALCULUS MADE EASY

26

Then:

y + dy = (x + dx)3 + 5 = x3 + 3x2 dx + 3x(dx)2 + (dx)3 + 5.

Neglecting the small quantities of higher orders, this becomes

y + dy = x3 + 3x2 · dx + 5.

Subtract the original y = x3 + 5, and we have left:

dy = 3x2 dx. dy = 3x2. dx So the 5 has quite disappeared. It added nothing to the growth of x, and does not enter into the differential coefficient. If we had put 7, or 700, or any other number, instead of 5, it would have disappeared. So if we take the letter a, or b, or c to represent any constant, it will simply disappear when we differentiate. If the additional constant had been of negative value, such as −5 or −b, it would equally have disappeared.
Multiplied Constants. Take as a simple experiment this case: Let y = 7x2. Then on proceeding as before we get:
y + dy = 7(x + dx)2 = 7{x2 + 2x · dx + (dx)2} = 7x2 + 14x · dx + 7(dx)2.

WHAT TO DO WITH CONSTANTS

27

Then, subtracting the original y = 7x2, and neglecting the last term, we have
dy = 14x · dx. dy = 14x. dx

Let us illustrate this example by working out the graphs of the equations y = 7x2 and dy = 14x, by assigning to x a set of successive
dx values, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., and finding the corresponding values of y and of dy .
dx These values we tabulate as follows:

x0

1 2 3 4 5 −1 −2 −3

y

0

7 28 63 112 175 7 28 63

dy

0

14 28 42 56 70 −14 −28 −42

dx

Now plot these values to some convenient scale, and we obtain the two curves, Figs. 6 and 6a.
Carefully compare the two figures, and verify by inspection that the height of the ordinate of the derived curve, Fig. 6a, is proportional to the slope of the original curve,* Fig. 6, at the corresponding value of x. To the left of the origin, where the original curve slopes negatively (that is, downward from left to right) the corresponding ordinates of the derived curve are negative.
Now if we look back at p. 18, we shall see that simply differentiating x2 gives us 2x. So that the differential coefficient of 7x2 is just
*See p. 76 about slopes of curves.

7 times as big as that of x2. If we had taken 8x2, the differential coeffi-

cient would have come out eight times as great as that of x2. If we put

y = ax2, we shall get

dy = a × 2x. dx

If we had begun with y = axn, we should have had dy = a × nxn−1. dx
So that any mere multiplication by a constant reappears as a mere

multiplication when the thing is differentiated. And, what is true about

multiplication is equally true about division: for if, in the example

above,

whether the expression can be put in a simpler form.

involving x only.

Squaring, we get

which simplifies to

or that is

(a − b)2y2 + (a + b)2x2 = x2(a2 − b2) + y2(a2 − b2); [(a − b)2 − (a2 − b2)]y2 = [(a2 − b2) − (a + b)2]x2,

(4) The volume of a cylinder of radius r and height h is given by the formula V = πr2h. Find the rate of variation of volume with the radius when r = 5.5 in. and h = 20 in. If r = h, find the dimensions of the cylinder so that a change of 1 in. in radius causes a change of 400 cub. in. in the volume.
The rate of variation of V with regard to r is dV = 2πrh. dr
If r = 5.5 in. and h = 20 in. this becomes 690.8. It means that a change of radius of 1 inch will cause a change of volume of 690.8 cub. inch. This can be easily verified, for the volumes with r = 5 and r = 6 are 1570 cub. in. and 2260.8 cub. in. respectively, and 2260.8 − 1570 = 690.8.

CHAPTER VI.
SUMS, DIFFERENCES, PRODUCTS AND QUOTIENTS.
We have learned how to differentiate simple algebraical functions such as x2 + c or ax4, and we have now to consider how to tackle the sum of two or more functions.
For instance, let
y = (x2 + c) + (ax4 + b); what will its dy be? How are we to go to work on this new job?
dx The answer to this question is quite simple: just differentiate them, one after the other, thus:
dy = 2x + 4ax3. (Ans.) dx If you have any doubt whether this is right, try a more general case, working it by first principles. And this is the way. Let y = u+v, where u is any function of x, and v any other function of x. Then, letting x increase to x + dx, y will increase to y + dy; and u will increase to u + du; and v to v + dv. And we shall have:
y + dy = u + du + v + dv.

SUMS, DIFFERENCES, PRODUCTS

35

Subtracting the original y = u + v, we get

dy = du + dv,

and dividing through by dx, we get:

dy

=

du

+

dv .

dx dx dx

This justifies the procedure. You differentiate each function sep-

arately and add the results. So if now we take the example of the

preceding paragraph, and put in the values of the two functions, we

shall have, using the notation shown (p. 16),

dy = d(x2 + c) + d(ax4 + b)

dx

dx

dx

= 2x

+ 4ax3,

that

y = u + v + w;

then

dy

=

du

+

dv

+

dw .

dx dx dx dx

As for subtraction, it follows at once; for if the function v had itself

had a negative sign, its differential coefficient would also be negative;

so that by differentiating

we should get

y = u − v,

dy

du

−

dv .

dx dx dx

CALCULUS MADE EASY

36

But when we come to do with Products, the thing is not quite so simple.
Suppose we were asked to differentiate the expression
y = (x2 + c) × (ax4 + b),
what are we to do? The result will certainly not be 2x × 4ax3; for it is easy to see that neither c × ax4, nor x2 × b, would have been taken into that product.
Now there are two ways in which we may go to work. First way. Do the multiplying first, and, having worked it out, then differentiate. Accordingly, we multiply together x2 + c and ax4 + b. This gives ax6 + acx4 + bx2 + bc. Now differentiate, and we get:
dy = 6ax5 + 4acx3 + 2bx. dx
Second way. Go back to first principles, and consider the equation
y = u × v;
where u is one function of x, and v is any other function of x. Then, if x grows to be x + dx; and y to y + dy; and u becomes u + du, and v becomes v + dv, we shall have:
y + dy = (u + du) × (v + dv) = u · v + u · dv + v · du + du · dv.

SUMS, DIFFERENCES, PRODUCTS

37

Now du · dv is a small quantity of the second order of smallness, and therefore in the limit may be discarded, leaving
y + dy = u · v + u · dv + v · du.

Then, subtracting the original y = u · v, we have left

dy = u · dv + v · du;

and, dividing through by dx, we get the result:

dy

=

u

dv

+v

du .

dx dx dx

This shows that our instructions will be as follows: To differentiate the product of two functions, multiply each function by the differential coefficient of the other, and add together the two products so obtained.
You should note that this process amounts to the following: Treat u as constant while you differentiate v; then treat v as constant while you differentiate u; and the whole differential coefficient dy will be the sum
dx of these two treatments.
Now, having found this rule, apply it to the concrete example which was considered above.
We want to differentiate the product

(x2 + c) × (ax4 + b).

Call (x2 + c) = u; and (ax4 + b) = v.

CALCULUS MADE EASY

38

Then, by the general rule just established, we may write:

dy = (x2 + c) d(ax4 + b) + (ax4 + b) d(x2 + c)

dx

dx

dx

= (x2 + c) 4ax3

+ (ax4 + b) 2x

= 4ax5 + 4acx3

+ 2ax5 + 2bx,

dy = 6ax5 + 4acx3 dx

+ 2bx,

exactly as before.

Lastly, we have to differentiate quotients.

Think of this example, y =

bx5 + c x2 + a

.

In such a case it is no use to

try to work out the division beforehand, because x2 + a will not divide

into bx5 + c, neither have they any common factor. So there is nothing

for it but to go back to first principles, and find a rule.

So we will put

y = u; v

where u and v are two different functions of the independent variable x. Then, when x becomes x + dx, y will become y + dy; and u will become u + du; and v will become v + dv. So then

y

+

dy

=

u v

+ +

du .
dv

Now perform the algebraic division, thus:

v + dv

u + du u + u · dv

u + du − u · dv

du − u · dv v
du + du · dv v

− u · dv − du · dv

v

v2

As both these remainders are small quantities of the second order, they may be neglected, and the division may stop here, since any further remainders would be of still smaller magnitudes.
So we have got:

y

+ dy

=

u v

+

du v

−

u

· dv v2

;

which may be written

=

This gives us our instructions as to how to differentiate a quotient

of two functions. Multiply the divisor function by the differential coef-

ficient of the dividend function; then multiply the dividend function by

the differential coefficient of the divisor function; and subtract. Lastly

divide by the square of the divisor function.

CHAPTER VII.

SUCCESSIVE DIFFERENTIATION.
Let us try the effect of repeating several times over the operation of differentiating a function (see p. 13). Begin with a concrete case.
Let y = x5.

First differentiation, 5x4.

Second differentiation, 5 × 4x3

= 20x3.

Third differentiation, 5 × 4 × 3x2

= 60x2.

Fourth differentiation, 5 × 4 × 3 × 2x = 120x.

Fifth differentiation, 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Sixth differentiation,

= 0.

There is a certain notation, with which we are already acquainted (see p. 14), used by some writers, that is very convenient. This is to employ the general symbol f (x) for any function of x. Here the symbol f ( ) is read as “function of,” without saying what particular function is meant. So the statement y = f (x) merely tells us that y is a function of x, it may be x2 or axn, or cos x or any other complicated function of x.

SUCCESSIVE DIFFERENTIATION

49

The corresponding symbol for the differential coefficient is f ′(x), which is simpler to write than dy . This is called the “derived function”
dx of x.
Suppose we differentiate over again, we shall get the “second derived function” or second differential coefficient, which is denoted by f ′′(x); and so on.
Now let us generalize. Let y = f (x) = xn.

First differentiation, Second differentiation, Third differentiation, Fourth differentiation,

f ′(x) = nxn−1. f ′′(x) = n(n − 1)xn−2. f ′′′(x) = n(n − 1)(n − 2)xn−3. f ′′′′(x) = n(n − 1)(n − 2)(n − 3)xn−4.
etc., etc.

But this is not the only way of indicating successive differentiations. For,

if the original function be

y = f (x);

once differentiating gives

dy = f ′(x); dx

twice differentiating gives

dy d
dx dx

= f ′′(x);

and

this

as

CHAPTER VIII.
WHEN TIME VARIES.
Some of the most important problems of the calculus are those where time is the independent variable, and we have to think about the values of some other quantity that varies when the time varies. Some things grow larger as time goes on; some other things grow smaller. The distance that a train has got from its starting place goes on ever increasing as time goes on. Trees grow taller as the years go by. Which is growing at the greater rate; a plant 12 inches high which in one month becomes 14 inches high, or a tree 12 feet high which in a year becomes 14 feet high?
In this chapter we are going to make much use of the word rate. Nothing to do with poor-rate, or water-rate (except that even here the word suggests a proportion—a ratio—so many pence in the pound). Nothing to do even with birth-rate or death-rate, though these words suggest so many births or deaths per thousand of the population. When a motor-car whizzes by us, we say: What a terrific rate! When a spendthrift is flinging about his money, we remark that that young man is living at a prodigious rate. What do we mean by rate? In both these cases we are making a mental comparison of something that is happening, and the length of time that it takes to happen. If the

WHEN TIME VARIES

53

motor-car flies past us going 10 yards per second, a simple bit of mental

arithmetic will show us that this is equivalent—while it lasts—to a rate

of 600 yards per minute, or over 20 miles per hour.

Now in what sense is it true that a speed of 10 yards per second

is the same as 600 yards per minute? Ten yards is not the same as

600 yards, nor is one second the same thing as one minute. What we

mean by saying that the rate is the same, is this: that the proportion

borne between distance passed over and time taken to pass over it, is

the same in both cases.

Take another example. A man may have only a few pounds in his

possession, and yet be able to spend money at the rate of millions

a year—provided he goes on spending money at that rate for a few

minutes only. Suppose you hand a shilling over the counter to pay

for some goods; and suppose the operation lasts exactly one second.

Then, during that brief operation, you are parting with your money

at the rate of 1 shilling per second, which is the same rate as £3 per

minute, or £180 per hour, or £4320 per day, or £1, 576, 800 per year!

If you have £10 in your pocket, you can go on spending money at the

rate

of

a

million

a

year

for

just

5

1 4

minutes.

It is said that Sandy had not been in London above five minutes

when “bang went saxpence.” If he were to spend money at that rate

all day long, say for 12 hours, he would be spending 6 shillings an hour,

or £3. 12s. per day, or £21. 12s. a week, not counting the Sawbbath.

Now try to put some of these ideas into differential notation.

Let y in this case stand for money, and let t stand for time.

If you are spending money, and the amount you spend in a short

CALCULUS MADE EASY

54

time dt be called dy, the rate of spending it will be dy , or rather, should dt
be written with a minus sign, as −dy , because dy is a decrement, not an dt
increment. But money is not a good example for the calculus, because

it generally comes and goes by jumps, not by a continuous flow—you
may earn £200 a year, but it does not keep running in all day long

in a thin stream; it comes in only weekly, or monthly, or quarterly, in

lumps: and your expenditure also goes out in sudden payments.

A more apt illustration of the idea of a rate is furnished by the

speed of a moving body. From London (Euston station) to Liverpool is

200 miles. If a train leaves London at 7 o’clock, and reaches Liverpool

at 11 o’clock, you know that, since it has travelled 200 miles in 4 hours,

its

average

rate

must

have

been

50

miles

per

hour;

because

200 4

=

50 1

.

Here you are really making a mental comparison between the distance

passed over and the time taken to pass over it. You are dividing one

by the other. If y is the whole distance, and t the whole time, clearly the average rate is y . Now the speed was not actually constant all the
t way: at starting, and during the slowing up at the end of the journey,

the speed was less. Probably at some part, when running downhill,

the speed was over 60 miles an hour. If, during any particular element

of time dt, the corresponding element of distance passed over was dy, then at that part of the journey the speed was dy . The rate at which
dt one quantity (in the present instance, distance) is changing in relation

to the other quantity (in this case, time) is properly expressed, then,

by stating the differential coefficient of one with respect to the other.

A velocity, scientifically expressed, is the rate at which a very small

distance in any given direction is being passed over; and may therefore

WHEN TIME VARIES

55

be written

v

=

dy .

dt

But if the velocity v is not uniform, then it must be either increasing

or else decreasing. The rate at which a velocity is increasing is called the

acceleration. If a moving body is, at any particular instant, gaining an

additional velocity dv in an element of time dt, then the acceleration a

at that instant may be written

a = dv ; dt

but dv is itself d dy . Hence we may put dt

dy d a = dt ;
dt

and this is usually written a = d2y ; dt2
or the acceleration is the second differential coefficient of the distance,

with respect to time. Acceleration is expressed as a change of velocity

in unit time, for instance, as being so many feet per second per second;

the notation used being feet ÷ second2.

When a railway train has just begun to move, its velocity v is small;

but it is rapidly gaining speed—it is being hurried up, or accelerated,

by

the

effort

of

the

engine.

So

its

d2y dt2

is

large.

When

it

has

got

up

its

d2y top speed it is no longer being accelerated, so that then dt2 has fallen

to zero. But when it nears its stopping place its speed begins to slow

down; may, indeed, slow down very quickly if the brakes are put on,

CALCULUS MADE EASY

56

and during this period of deceleration or slackening of pace, the value

of

dv , dt

that

is,

of

d2y dt2

will

be

negative.

To accelerate a mass m requires the continuous application of force.

The force necessary to accelerate a mass is proportional to the mass,

and it is also proportional to the acceleration which is being imparted.

Hence we may write for the force f , the expression

f = ma;

or

f = mdv ;

dt

or

f

=

d2y m.
dt2

The product of a mass by the speed at which it is going is called its

momentum, and is in symbols mv. If we differentiate momentum with respect to time we shall get d(mv) for the rate of change of momentum.
dt But, since m is a constant quantity, this may be written mdv , which
dt we see above is the same as f . That is to say, force may be expressed

either as mass times acceleration, or as rate of change of momentum.

Again, if a force is employed to move something (against an equal

and opposite counter-force), it does work ; and the amount of work done

is measured by the product of the force into the distance (in its own

direction) through which its point of application moves forward. So if

a force f moves forward through a length y, the work done (which we

may call w) will be

w = f × y;

where we take f as a constant force. If the force varies at different parts of the range y, then we must find an expression for its value from

WHEN TIME VARIES

57

point to point. If f be the force along the small element of length dy, the amount of work done will be f × dy. But as dy is only an element of length, only an element of work will be done. If we write w for work, then an element of work will be dw; and we have
dw = f × dy;

which may be written

dw = ma · dy;

or

dw

=

d2y m dt2

·

dy;

or

dw

=

dv m

·

dy.

dt

Further, we may transpose the expression and write

dw = f. dy
This gives us yet a third definition of force; that if it is being used to produce a displacement in any direction, the force (in that direction) is equal to the rate at which work is being done per unit of length in that direction. In this last sentence the word rate is clearly not used in its time-sense, but in its meaning as ratio or proportion.
Sir Isaac Newton, who was (along with Leibnitz) an inventor of the methods of the calculus, regarded all quantities that were varying as flowing; and the ratio which we nowadays call the differential coefficient he regarded as the rate of flowing, or the fluxion of the quantity in question. He did not use the notation of the dy and dx, and dt (this was due to Leibnitz), but had instead a notation of his own. If y was a quantity

CALCULUS MADE EASY

58

that varied, or “flowed,” then his symbol for its rate of variation (or

“fluxion”) was y˙. If x was the variable, then its fluxion was called x˙ .

The dot over the letter indicated that it had been differentiated. But

this notation does not tell us what is the independent variable with respect to which the differentiation has been effected. When we see dy
dt we know that y is to be differentiated with respect to t. If we see dy
dx we know that y is to be differentiated with respect to x. But if we see

merely y˙, we cannot tell without looking at the context whether this is to mean dy or dy or dy , or what is the other variable. So, therefore,
dx dt dz this fluxional notation is less informing than the differential notation,

and has in consequence largely dropped out of use. But its simplicity

gives it an advantage if only we will agree to use it for those cases ex-

clusively where time is the independent variable. In that case y˙ will

dy

du

d2x

mean

dt

and u˙ will mean

; and x¨ will mean dt

dt2 .

Adopting this fluxional notation we may write the mechanical equa-

tions considered in the paragraphs above, as follows:

distance velocity acceleration force work

x, v = x˙ , a = v˙ = x¨, f = mv˙ = mx¨, w = x × mx¨.

Examples. (1) A body moves so that the distance x (in feet), which it travels from a certain point O, is given by the relation x = 0.2t2 + 10.4, where t is the time in seconds elapsed since a certain instant. Find the velocity

WHEN TIME VARIES

59

and acceleration 5 seconds after the body began to move, and also find the corresponding values when the distance covered is 100 feet. Find also the average velocity during the first 10 seconds of its motion. (Suppose distances and motion to the right to be positive.)

Now

x = 0.2t2 + 10.4

v = x˙ = dx = 0.4t; and a = x¨ = d2x = 0.4 = constant.

dt

dt2

When t = 0, x = 10.4 and v = 0. The body started from a point

10.4 feet to the right of the point O; and the time was reckoned from

the instant the body started. When t = 5, v = 0.4 × 5 = 2 ft./sec.; a = 0.4 ft./sec2.

When x = 100, 100 = 0.2t2 + 10.4, or t2 = 448, and t = 21.17 sec.;

v = 0.4 × 21.17 = 8.468 ft./sec.

When t = 10,

distance travelled = 0.2 × 102 + 10.4 − 10.4 = 20 ft.

(It is the same velocity as the velocity at the middle of the interval, t = 5; for, the acceleration being constant, the velocity has varied uniformly from zero when t = 0 to 4 ft./sec. when t = 10.)
(2) In the above problem let us suppose

x = 0.2t2 + 3t + 10.4.

v = x˙ = dx = 0.4t + 3; a = x¨ = d2x = 0.4 = constant.

When t = 0, x = 10.4 and v = 3 ft./sec, the time is reckoned from

the instant at which the body passed a point 10.4 ft. from the point O,

CALCULUS MADE EASY

60

its velocity being then already 3 ft./sec. To find the time elapsed since

it

began

moving,

let

v

=

0;

then

0.4t + 3

=

0,

t

=

−

3 .4

=

−7.5

sec.

The body began moving 7.5 sec. before time was begun to be observed;

5 seconds after this gives t = −2.5 and v = 0.4 × −2.5 + 3 = 2 ft./sec.

When x = 100 ft.,

100 = 0.2t2 + 3t + 10.4; or t2 + 15t − 448 = 0;

hence t = 14.95 sec., v = 0.4 × 14.95 + 3 = 8.98 ft./sec. To find the distance travelled during the 10 first seconds of the
motion one must know how far the body was from the point O when it started.
When t = −7.5,

x = 0.2 × (−7.5)2 − 3 × 7.5 + 10.4 = −0.85 ft.,

that is 0.85 ft. to the left of the point O. Now, when t = 2.5,

x = 0.2 × 2.52 + 3 × 2.5 + 10.4 = 19.15.

So, in 10 seconds, the distance travelled was 19.15 + 0.85 = 20 ft.,

and

the average velocity

=

20 10

=

2

ft./sec.

(3) Consider a similar problem when the distance is given by x =

0.2t2 − 3t + 10.4. Then v = 0.4t − 3, a = 0.4 = constant. When

t = 0, x = 10.4 as before, and v = −3; so that the body was moving

in the direction opposite to its motion in the previous cases. As the

acceleration is positive, however, we see that this velocity will decrease

WHEN TIME VARIES

61

as time goes on, until it becomes zero, when v = 0 or 0.4t − 3 = 0; or t = 7.5 sec. After this, the velocity becomes positive; and 5 seconds after the body started, t = 12.5, and

v = 0.4 × 12.5 − 3 = 2 ft./sec.

When x = 100,

100 = 0.2t2 − 3t + 10.4, or t2 − 15t − 448 = 0,

and

t = 29.95; v = 0.4 × 29.95 − 3 = 8.98 ft./sec.

When v is zero, x = 0.2 × 7.52 − 3 × 7.5 + 10.4 = −0.85, informing us that the body moves back to 0.85 ft. beyond the point O before it stops. Ten seconds later

t = 17.5 and x = 0.2 × 17.52 − 3 × 17.5 + 10.4 = 19.15.

The distance travelled = .85 + 19.15 = 20.0, and the average velocity is again 2 ft./sec.
(4) Consider yet another problem of the same sort with x = 0.2t3 − 3t2 + 10.4; v = 0.6t2 − 6t; a = 1.2t − 6. The acceleration is no more constant.
When t = 0, x = 10.4, v = 0, a = −6. The body is at rest, but just ready to move with a negative acceleration, that is to gain a velocity towards the point O.
(5) If we have x = 0.2t3 − 3t + 10.4, then v = 0.6t2 − 3, and a = 1.2t. When t = 0, x = 10.4; v = −3; a = 0. The body is moving towards the point O with a velocity of 3 ft./sec., and just at that instant the velocity is uniform.

CALCULUS MADE EASY

62

We see that the conditions of the motion can always be at once ascertained from the time-distance equation and its first and second derived functions. In the last two cases the mean velocity during the first 10 seconds and the velocity 5 seconds after the start will no more be the same, because the velocity is not increasing uniformly, the acceleration being no longer constant.
(6) The angle θ (in radians) turned through by a wheel is given by θ = 3 + 2t − 0.1t3, where t is the time in seconds from a certain instant; find the angular velocity ω and the angular acceleration α, (a) after 1 second; (b) after it has performed one revolution. At what time is it at rest, and how many revolutions has it performed up to that instant?
Writing for the acceleration

ω = θ˙ = dθ = 2 − 0.3t2, dt

α

=

θ¨ =

d2θ dt2

=

−0.6t.

When t = 0, θ = 3; ω = 2 rad./sec.; α = 0. When t = 1,

ω = 2 − 0.3 = 1.7 rad./sec.; α = −0.6 rad./sec2.

This is a retardation; the wheel is slowing down. After 1 revolution

θ = 2π = 6.28; 6.28 = 3 + 2t − 0.1t3.

By plotting the graph, θ = 3 + 2t − 0.1t3, we can get the value or values of t for which θ = 6.28; these are 2.11 and 3.03 (there is a third negative value).

WHEN TIME VARIES

63

When t = 2.11,
θ = 6.28; ω = 2 − 1.34 = 0.66 rad./sec.; α = −1.27 rad./sec2.

When t = 3.03,

θ = 6.28; ω = 2 − 2.754 = −0.754 rad./sec.; α = −1.82 rad./sec2.

The velocity is reversed. The wheel is evidently at rest between these two instants; it is at rest when ω = 0, that is when 0 = 2 − 0.3t3, or when t = 2.58 sec., it has performed

INTRODUCING A USEFUL DODGE.

Sometimes one is stumped by finding that the expression to be differ-

entiated is too complicated to tackle directly.

Thus, the equation

y

is awkward to a beginner. Now the dodge to turn the difficulty is this: Write some symbol,
such as u, for the expression x2 + a2; then the equation becomes

y

u2,

which you can easily manage; for

dy

=

31 u2.

Then tackle the expression

u = x2 + a2,

Let P QR, in Fig. 7, be a portion of a curve plotted with respect to the axes of coordinates OX and OY . Consider any point Q on this curve, where the abscissa of the point is x and its ordinate is y. Now observe how y changes when x is varied. If x is made to increase by

CALCULUS MADE EASY

76

a small increment dx, to the right, it will be observed that y also (in this particular curve) increases by a small increment dy (because this particular curve happens to be an ascending curve). Then the ratio of dy to dx is a measure of the degree to which the curve is sloping up between the two points Q and T . As a matter of fact, it can be seen on the figure that the curve between Q and T has many different slopes, so that we cannot very well speak of the slope of the curve between Q and T . If, however, Q and T are so near each other that the small portion QT of the curve is practically straight, then it is true to say that the ratio dy is the slope of the curve along QT . The straight line QT
dx produced on either side touches the curve along the portion QT only, and if this portion is indefinitely small, the straight line will touch the curve at practically one point only, and be therefore a tangent to the curve.
This tangent to the curve has evidently the same slope as QT , so that dy is the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point Q for which
dx the value of dy is found.
dx We have seen that the short expression “the slope of a curve” has no precise meaning, because a curve has so many slopes—in fact, every small portion of a curve has a different slope. “The slope of a curve at a point” is, however, a perfectly defined thing; it is the slope of a very small portion of the curve situated just at that point; and we have seen that this is the same as “the slope of the tangent to the curve at that point.” Observe that dx is a short step to the right, and dy the corresponding short step upwards. These steps must be considered as short as

MEANING OF DIFFERENTIATION

possible—in fact indefinitely short,—though in diagrams we have to represent them by bits that are not infinitesimally small, otherwise they could not be seen.
We shall hereafter make considerable use of this circumstance that dy represents the slope of the curve at any point. dx

If a curve is sloping up at 45◦ at a particular point, as in Fig. 8, dy and dx will be equal, and the value of dy = 1.
dx If the curve slopes up steeper than 45◦ (Fig. 9), dy will be greater
dx than 1.
If the curve slopes up very gently, as in Fig. 10, dy will be a fraction dx
smaller than 1. For a horizontal line, or a horizontal place in a curve, dy = 0, and
therefore dy = 0. dx
If a curve slopes downward, as in Fig. 11, dy will be a step down, and must therefore be reckoned of negative value; hence dy will have
dx negative sign also.

If the “curve” happens to be a straight line, like that in Fig. 12, the value of dy will be the same at all points along it. In other words its
dx slope is constant.
If a curve is one that turns more upwards as it goes along to the right, the values of dy will become greater and greater with the in-
dx creasing steepness, as in Fig. 13.
If a curve is one that gets flatter and flatter as it goes along, the values of dy will become smaller and smaller as the flatter part is

reached, as in Fig. 14. If a curve first descends, and then goes up again, as in Fig. 15,
presenting a concavity upwards, then clearly dy will first be negative, dx
with diminishing values as the curve flattens, then will be zero at the point where the bottom of the trough of the curve is reached; and from this point onward dy will have positive values that go on increasing. In
dx such a case y is said to pass by a minimum. The minimum value of y is not necessarily the smallest value of y, it is that value of y corresponding to the bottom of the trough; for instance, in Fig. 28 (p. 99), the value of y corresponding to the bottom of the trough is 1, while y takes

elsewhere values which are smaller than this. The characteristic of a

minimum is that y must increase on either side of it.

N.B.—For the particular value of x that makes y a minimum, the value of dy = 0.
dx If a curve first ascends and then descends, the values of dy will be
dx positive at first; then zero, as the summit is reached; then negative,

as the curve slopes downwards, as in Fig. 16. In this case y is said to

pass by a maximum, but the maximum value of y is not necessarily the

greatest value of y.

the

but

this

by no means the greatest value y can have at some other point of the

curve.

N.B.—For the particular value of x that makes y a maximum, the value of dy = 0.
dx If a curve has the peculiar form of Fig. 17, the values of dy will
dx always be positive; but there will be one particular place where the slope is least steep, where the value of dy will be a minimum; that is,
dx less than it is at any other part of the curve.

Now that we understand that dy measures the steepness of a curve dx
at any point, let us turn to some of the equations which we have already learned how to differentiate.

(1) As the simplest case take this:

y = x + b.

It is plotted out in Fig. 19, using equal scales for x and y. If we put x = 0, then the corresponding ordinate will be y = b; that is to say, the “curve” crosses the y-axis at the height b. From here it ascends at 45◦;

for whatever values we give to x to the right, we have an equal y to ascend. The line has a gradient of 1 in 1.
Now differentiate y = x + b, by the rules we have already learned (pp. 21 and 25 ante), and we get dy = 1.
dx The slope of the line is such that for every little step dx to the right, we go an equal little step dy upward. And this slope is constant—always the same slope. (2) Take another case:

y = ax + b.

MEANING OF DIFFERENTIATION

83

We know that this curve, like the preceding one, will start from a

height b on the y-axis. But before we draw the curve, let us find its slope by differentiating; which gives dy = a. The slope will be constant,
dx at an angle, the tangent of which is here called a. Let us assign to a

some

numerical

value—say

1 3

.

Then

we

must

give

it

such

a

slope

that

it ascends 1 in 3; or dx will be 3 times as great as dy; as magnified in

Fig. 21. So, draw the line in Fig. 20 at this slope.

Fig. 21.

(3) Now for a slightly harder case.

Let

y = ax2 + b.

Again the curve will start on the y-axis at a height b above the origin.
Now differentiate. [If you have forgotten, turn back to p. 25; or, rather, don’t turn back, but think out the differentiation.]
dy = 2ax. dx
This shows that the steepness will not be constant: it increases as x increases. At the starting point P , where x = 0, the curve (Fig. 22) has no steepness—that is, it is level. On the left of the origin, where x has negative values, dy will also have negative values, or will descend
dx from left to right, as in the Figure.

Now assign a few successive values, say from 0 to 5, to x; and calculate the corresponding values of y by the first equation; and of dy from the

dx those of x. For any assigned value of x, the height of the ordinate in the second curve is proportional to the slope of the first curve.

(4) Find the slope of the tangent to the curve

y

at the point where x = −1. Find the angle which this tangent makes

with the curve y = 2x2 + 2.

The slope of the tangent is the slope of the curve at the point where

dy

they touch one another (see p. 76); that is, it is the of the curve for

dx

that

point.

Here

dy dx

=

−

1 2x2

and

for

x = −1,

dy dx

=

which

is

the

slope of the tangent and of the curve at that point. The tangent, being

a straight line, has for equation y = ax + b, and its slope is dy = a,

hence

if

y

and

as

the

tangent passes by this point, the coordinates of the point must satisfy

the equation of the tangent, namely

so

that

and

the

therefore

Now, when two curves meet, the intersection being a point com-

mon to both curves, its coordinates must satisfy the equation of each

one of the two curves; that is, it must be a solution of the system of

simultaneous equations formed by coupling together the equations of

the curves. Here the curves meet one another at points given by the

solution of

The

slope

of

the curve y = 2x2 + 2 at any point is

dy = 4x. dx

For the point where x = 0, this slope is zero; the curve is horizontal.

For the point where

x

=

−

1 4

,

dy = −1; dx

hence the curve at that point slopes downwards to the right at such

an angle θ with the horizontal that tan θ = 1; that is, at 45◦ to the

horizontal.

The

that is, an angle of 26◦ 34′. It follows that at the first point the curve

cuts the straight line at an angle of 26◦ 34′, while at the second it cuts

it at an angle of 45◦ − 26◦ 34′ = 18◦ 26′.

(5) A straight line is to be drawn, through a point whose coordinates

are x = 2, y = −1, as tangent to the curve y = x2 − 5x + 6. Find the

coordinates of the point of contact. The slope of the tangent must be the same as the dy of the curve; dx
that is, 2x − 5.

The equation of the straight line is y = ax+b, and as it is satisfied for the values x = 2, y = −1, then −1 = a×2+b; also, its dy = a = 2x−5.
dx The x and the y of the point of contact must also satisfy both the

equation of the tangent and the equation of the curve.

four equations in a, b, x, y. Equations (i) and (ii) give x2 − 5x + 6 = ax + b. Replacing a and b by their value in this, we get

x2 − 5x + 6 = (2x − 5)x − 1 − 2(2x − 5),

which simplifies to x2 − 4x + 3 = 0, the solutions of which are: x = 3 and x = 1. Replacing in (i), we get y = 0 and y = 2 respectively; the two points of contact are then x = 1, y = 2, and x = 3, y = 0.
Note.—In all exercises dealing with curves, students will find it extremely instructive to verify the deductions obtained by actually plotting the curves.
