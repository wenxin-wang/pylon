Download GitHub Slack Us

Augment your current security infrastructure to store and index network traffic in standard PCAP format.
Moloch is not meant to replace Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), instead it provides more visibility.
Security

Access to Moloch is protected by using HTTPS with digest passwords or by using an authentication providing web server proxy. All PCAPs are stored on the installed Moloch sensors and are only available through the Moloch web interface or API. Moloch supports encrypting PCAP files at rest.

Want to report a security issue or just learn more? There's more info here .
Scalability

Moloch is designed to be deployed across multiple clustered systems providing the ability to scale to handle multiple gigabits per second of traffic. PCAP retention is based on available sensor disk space while metadata retention is based on the scale of the Elasticsearch cluster. Both can be increased at anytime.
Interface

A web application is provided for PCAP browsing, searching, analysis, and PCAP carving for exporting. Moloch stores and exports all packets in standard PCAP format allowing you to use your favorite PCAP ingesting tools during your analysis workflow.
APIs

APIs are exposed that allow PCAP data and JSON-formatted session data to be downloaded directly.
