INTRODUCTION
Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental opinion of the day; but a series of oppressions, begun at a distinguished period, and pursued unalterably through every change of ministers too plainly proves a deliberate, systematic plan of reducing us to slavery.
—THOMAS JEFFERSON
TODAY JEFFERSON’S WORDS MIGHT read, “An occasional act of tyranny may be excused as a momentary lapse of judgment by officials, but a continuous series of such acts pursued through both Democratic and Republican administrations clearly proves there is a deliberate and systematic plan to reduce once-free Americans to slavery.”
To be a zombie is to exist under the most onerous bonds of slavery—bonds that allow for no thought to one’s action. Zombies are controlled both mentally and physically

by some outside force, whether through a virus causing them to seek blood, or voodoo magic. A zombie is neither dead nor alive and usually under the control of someone else, as in the old Hollywood films. Zombies stumble about, largely unaware of the world around them, intent on purposes that others have created for them through alchemy or electromagnetism. In old horror movies, actors Bela Lugosi and John Carradine controlled zombies, causing them to commit acts that ran against human nature.
And now zombies are everywhere. They’re highly popular grists for movies, books, comics, and computer games. Is it just a coincidence that zombies are so popular, or is it possible that Americans like zombies because they offer us a reflection of how we perceive ourselves—as barely alive and living mindlessly?
Many individuals today stumble through their daily chores without caring or knowing why they do so. These people might be numbed by drugs or the incessant bombardment by the broadcast media, but whatever the case, many Americans seem like zombies in so many ways.
The term “zombie” is being applied to more and more aspects of life in modern America. Adderall is one of the most popular of the faddish new psychiatric drugs to combat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This drug consists of equal amounts of the stimulants amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. In fact, ADHDTreatment.org describes a side effect of Adderall as “zombie” demeanor.

The word “zombie” has so pervaded our society that it has worked its way into the scientific community’s lexicon. In mid-May 2009, researchers at the University of Texas and Texas A&M’s AgriLife Extension Service in east Texas reported that they had found a way to control the state’s fire ant infestation. They discovered that the tiny phorid fly, a native of the South American region where the fire ants in Texas originated, could “dive-bomb” the ants and lay eggs on them. The eggs would hatch inside the ants and eat away their brains, turning them into what scientists called “zombie ants.” The ants would wander aimlessly for about two weeks until their heads fell off.
Not only does the word describe how we view our own existence, but it has—and can still be—applied to the dissolution of the pillars of our society, most notably our banks. During the recent financial fiasco, the banks whose liabilities exceeded their assets were called “zombie banks.” As author Bill Sardi, a regular contributor to LewRockwell.com, explained, “Zombie banks are defined as a financial institution with an economic net worth that is less than zero, but which continues to operate because its ability to repay its debts is shored up by implicit or explicit government credit support.” In a sense, they were dead but still going through the motions of life.
America is now confronted with an economic situation that is being compared to the Great Depression, and the only solutions seem to lie in aggregating debt, deflating the

value of the dollar, and moving riches around. Not only that, but the scale of our economic problems has vastly increased. On October 1, 2008, the national debt was $10 trillion, but during 2009 it climbed to nearly $12 trillion, the single largest increase in a year. If every American man, woman, and child were to liquidate every asset he or she owns, the total could not equal this debt.
The term “trillion” is bandied about lightly by the mass media. Yet most people cannot truly conceive of the significance of such a number. A trillion square miles would encompass 3.7 million states the size of Texas (which covers approximately 270,000 square miles). A trillion dollars—on the other hand—could be made of one-dollar bills stretching all the way to our sun and back. If banking institutions that operate at a deficit are called “zombie banks,” then couldn’t we call a country whose debts exceed its assets a zombie nation? And perhaps this epithet also could be applied to its citizens?
In 2008, many saw the nation turn from National Socialism to Marxist Socialism when the totalitarian Bush administration turned over power to the Obama administration—an administration that favors socialist Medicare policies and redistributions of wealth. America’s zombies now face a further loss of individual freedoms due to corrupt politics, corporate malfeasance, and legislation that continues to curtail individual freedom. As readers of Rule by Secrecy and The Rise of the Fourth Reich will

understand, the global financiers—the global plutocrats of Wall Street, London, and Switzerland—have manipulated Western history for at least the past century, first by creating the Federal Reserve in America by deceitful political machinations, then communism in Russia by funding the Bolsheviks rather than the White Russians, and followed by financing National Socialism (Nazis) in Germany. Now these global financiers have taken control of the United States and are changing it in such ways that we now live in a society unimaginable to citizens of just two decades ago.
For instance, in the 1950s, Ronald Reagan publicly warned against socialized medicine. Today, the argument is just how socialized it will be. The information highway is a traffic jam of hype, misinformation, disinformation, distractions, and propaganda. New attempts to transform technology, health care, education, and the political system are being reported every day.
More and more Americans have been forced to focus on the dark side of contemporary life. Now, we live under the tyranny of a New World Order—a world that has been reordered by a small group of wealthy financiers and industrialists centered within secret societies such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and the Bilderberg group. Also, one must consider how this new world has become more and more a surveillance society and police state existing under a financially unstable infrastructure and fed by corporations that hold monopolies on food, water, and drugs. Are we living under a fascistic government? Possibly. The American Heritage

Dictionary of the English Language defines fascism as “a philosophy or system of government that advocates or exercises a dictatorship of the extreme right, typically through the merging of state and business leadership together with an ideology of belligerent nationalism.” Today, of course, the dictatorship would be of the extreme left, but nevertheless would include the power of both the government and the corporations that have their hands in public affairs.
Many people today believe the United States is going to hell in a hand-basket—that the United States is no longer a vibrant republic based on constitutional law but rather a brain-dead and decaying empire being taken over by an entrenched financial elite who seek a worldwide socialist order to dominate. This belief grows among Americans as they read the daily headlines and listen to the electronic mass media. People are seeking true change, not mere political rhetoric, but they feel befuddled as they can’t understand who precisely has hijacked their country.
Some Americans are acting out. In “tea parties” and in a massive demonstration in Washington on September 12, 2009, tens of thousands of Americans displayed their dissatisfaction with where the nation is going.
What does one call a country that seems to be merely mimicking the robust republic it used to be, whose population has been dumbed down by controversial educational programs, drugged out by an ever-growing pharmaceutical industry, and frightened into submission by constant threats of terrorism and economic collapse?

Would this not be a zombie nation? A nation that goes through the motions in commerce, politics, health, and education but without a spark of life, verve, or enthusiasm?
This is the true horror story. What happened? How did the nation get this way? Was it simply a case of inattention by the electorate, the natural evolution of a society grown prosperous and complacent, overreaching greed and lust for profit by corporate leaders? Or could it have been a conspiracy?

PART I

A ZOMBIE NATION
I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. As a result of the war, corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a fewhands, and the Republic is destroyed.
—ATTRIBUTED TO ABRAHAM LINCOLN

ECONOMIC DECLINE
TIMES ARE TOUGH FOR AMERICA. Thanks to what Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
called the failure of America’s financial system, by the start of 2010 more than $5 trillion of household wealth had evaporated. About one in every eight mortgages was in default or foreclosure. It is predicted that there will be ten million foreclosures on homes through 2012. One in every eight adults and one in four children now subsist on government food stamps.
All of these problems were exacerbated by high rates of unemployment. According to an Associated Press report, one in every five Americans is unemployed or underemployed, with the number expected to rise in 2010, causing the second-highest unemployment figure since World War II.
Dissension and dissatisfaction are widespread, and they’re linked to the poor economy. If the economy were the hands of a zombie, those hands would be bound by debt.
Charles K. Rowley is a professor of economics at George Mason University and general director of the Locke

Institute in Fairfax, Virginia. He is widely considered to be a major voice in political and economic thought. In an article for the United Kingdom’s Daily Telegraph, Rowley wrote: “The US economy suffers from a growing culture of indebtedness that has increasingly contaminated the federal government since 2001 and has spilled over dramatically into private household behavior.” He also raised a popular question, asking, “If excessive government indebtedness is a major source of the problem, why increase the government debt? Why encourage households to go yet further into debt?” Ominously, Rowley predicted “it is not impossible that the US will experience the kind of economic collapse from first- to third-world status experienced by Argentina under the national socialist governance of Juan Peron.” In other words, if the U.S. government cannot find ways of living within its means, as most families are forced to do, the nation may fall into third-world status, complete with scarcities of food and water, consumer goods, and socialized government control.
One of the barely noticed aspects of the financial crisis is the substantial drop in tax revenues, even as the Obama administration and Congress spend more to stimulate the economy. According to CNN, through the end of August 2009, the federal government collected 25 percent less tax revenue than for the same eight-month period in 2008. The Congressional Budget Office predicted tax receipts would fall to 14 percent of the gross domestic product, a sharp decline from the historical average of 18.3 percent.

Additionally, individual income tax revenues fell 20 percent while corporate income taxes dropped a whopping 56 percent. Predictions for 2010 were not much better.
And the loss of governmental revenue has filtered down to local governments. Increasing unemployment has caused thirty-two state unemployment insurance trust funds to fall below the recommended federal level, indicating these states will require massive federal loans to continue assistance for the jobless. Officials in Vigo County, Indiana, announced in mid-2009 that they could no longer afford to bury a dead person if that dead person had no savings, insurance, or family money set aside for a funeral. In Atlanta, citizens’ groups have tried to stop city plans to demolish its remaining public housing units. More than twenty counties in Michigan have reverted paved roads to gravel in an effort to save money, according to the County Road Association of Michigan.
The Wall Street Journal has reported that 90 percent of all U.S. businesses are family owned or controlled. The financial crisis has forced many to close their doors. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the fourth quarter of 2008, some four million firms with nineteen or fewer employees went out of business.
The American public in 2009 managed to actually increase their savings, but runaway deficit spending by the government undermined their efforts. Peter Schiff, the author of Crash Proof, explained, “The simple truth is that government debt is our debt. So if a family manages, at

some cost to their lifestyle, to squirrel away an extra $1,000 in saving this year, but the government adds $20,000 in new debt per household (each family’s approximate share of the $1.8 trillion fiscal 2009 deficit), that family ends up owing $19,000 more than they did at the beginning of the year!”
SOCIALISM AND LOSS OF INDIVIDUALITY
SOCIALISM IS A KEY word in understanding what has happened to America. Most dictionaries define “socialism” as the collective ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods and services. Invariably, a centralized authority is needed to administer these means.
The communist leader Vladimir Ilyich Lenin foresaw a worker’s paradise where “Each person will be voluntarily engaged in work according to his capacities, and each will freely take according to his needs.” But, as Lenin noted, before a person could freely take from the State, that person must become subordinate to the State.
“All our lives we fought against exalting the individual,” said Lenin. Espousing the same agenda of the early-day Western globalists who funded the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution of 1917, Lenin proclaimed, “The aim of socialism is not only to abolish the present division of

mankind into small states and all-national isolation, not only to bring the nations closer to each other, but also to merge them.” He also may have foreseen the methods being used to bring down the American Republic when he said, “The surest way to destroy a nation is to debauch its currency” and “Give me four years to teach the children and the seed I have sown will never be uprooted.”
As former assistant secretary of the Treasury Paul Craig Roberts stated in a treatise on the first principles of freedom, “A person born before the turn of the [20th] century was born a private individual. He was born into a world in which his existence was attested by his mere physical presence, without documents, forms, permits, licenses, orders, lists of currency carried in and out, identity cards, draft cards, ration cards, exit stamps, customs declarations, questionnaires, tax forms, reports in multuplicate [sic], social security number, or other authentications of his being, birth, nationality, status, beliefs, creed, right to be, enter, leave, move about, work, trade, purchase, dwell…. Many people take private individuals for granted, and they will find what I am saying farfetched. But private individuals do not exist in the Soviet Union or in China where the claims of the state are total and even art and literature must be subservient to the interests of the state….”
Roberts presented an example of how bureaucracy has begun to erode the liberties of American citizens: “[In the 1970s] US District Judge Wilbur Owens instructed the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia to

use involuntary transfers of faculty members between system institutions to achieve racial balance among the faculties. As long as the involuntary transfers of teachers was intra-city and confined to elementary and high school teachers, my liberal colleagues saw it as social progress. But once they faced inter-city involuntary transfers, they called it fascism. It is true that until the liberal progress of the 1960s, government direction of labor in this century was unique to the Hitler and Stalin regimes. As is often the case, people realize the consequences of statist ideas only when their own private individualities are touched.”
But the fleecing of America did not merely start in the 1970s. It’s been going on for many more decades. Consider a 1934 editorial cartoon published in the Chicago Tribune, entitled “Planned Economy or Planned Destruction?” In the drawing there are men identified as “Young Pinkies from Columbia and Harvard,” who are shoveling money from a cart. Beneath the cart sits a disheveled Leon Trotsky writing, “Plan of action for U.S.— Spend! Spend! Spend! Under the guise of recovery—Bust the Government—Blame the capitalists for the failure— Junk the Constitution and declare a dictatorship.” This cartoon might well have been drawn by a conservative cartoonist of today.
A few older citizens may recall the words of Norman Mattoon Thomas, a pacifist who ran for president six times between 1928 and 1948 under the Socialist Party of

America banner, “The American people will never knowingly adopt Socialism,” he said. “But under the name of ‘liberalism’ they will adopt every fragment of the Socialist program, until one day America will be a Socialist nation, without knowing how it happened.”
In a 1948 interview, Thomas said he was retiring from American politics because both the Democratic and Republican parties had adopted every plank of the Socialists’ platform and there was no longer a need for the alternative Socialist Party.
If Thomas was possibly correct in 1948, he is undoubtedly correct now. Many people see what once was termed “creeping socialism” in the United States now fullblown policy in Washington. This perception was reflected on the February 16, 2009, cover of Newsweek that declared, “We Are All Socialists Now.” Many Americans cringed at the nationalization of the banking and auto industries. They feared more would follow.
TEA PARTIES
BEGINNING IN APRIL 2009, protests against “out-ofcontrol” government spending, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the squabble over health care spread nationwide in citizen meetings termed “tea parties.” The name came from the original Boston Tea Party of 1773, when American colonists tossed shipments of tea into Boston Harbor in protest of the British government’s

“taxation without representation.” Many modern wits have pointed out, “If the colonists thought taxation without representation was bad, they should see taxation WITH representation.”
In 2009, the spirit of protest spilled over into several town hall meetings, where members of Congress, off for the summer recess, were shouted at and, in some cases, chased from the hall by constituents angered by what they saw as President Obama’s socialist health-care plan and general government malfeasance. This groundswell of public protest continued into 2010, with even more tea parties and demonstrations of anger over perceived socialist giveaway programs, the health-care crisis, corporate bailouts, and the destruction of the U.S. economy, all of which will be discussed later.
NEW WORLD ORDER
MANY CONCERNED CITIZENS TURNED to alternative radio talk shows and Internet blogs to learn more about a plan by globalists to control the world, one that President George H. W. Bush called the “New World Order.” It’s a term that Adolf Hitler once used. Self-styled globalists are those people who believe themselves above petty nationalism. These men and women deal with the planet Earth as their sphere of influence. Many view the United States as a not-so-profitable division of their multinational corporations. Globalists adhere to the old Illuminati

philosophy of “The end justifies the means,” although most would disdain any connection to that elder secret society or to the Nazis who carried this philosophy to its political extremes.
In the book Shadow Elite, Janine Wedel described globalists as “flexians,” members of a transnational elite, the “mover and shaker who serves at one and the same time as business consultant, think-tanker, TV pundit, and government adviser [and] glides in and around the organizations that enlist his services. It is not just his time that is divided. His loyalties, too, are often flexible.”
Despite the scoffs of “flexians” within the corporate mass media and bought-off politicians, a New World Order does exist and it often makes far-reaching plans. President T. Woodrow Wilson wrote that the bulk of money sent to Russia from the United States at the time of the Russian Revolution went to the Bolsheviks, the forerunners of the Communists. These funds came from the Rockefellers and other Wall Street capitalists such as Jacob Schiff, Elihu Root, J. P. Morgan, and the Harriman family (W. Averell Harriman became U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union during World War II). These men and others also provided initial funding for the Council on Foreign Relations.
When these same globalists became fearful of worldwide communism (they needed separate national or economic blocs to play off against each other for the tensions necessary for maximum profit and control), they supported National Socialism in Germany. German army intelligence agent Adolf Hitler was funded to provide a

bulwark against the Communist tide by enlarging his National Socialist German Workers Party (Nazis), in turn sowing the seeds of World War II. Three prominent Americans who were instrumental in funding the Nazis were National City Bank (now Citicorp) chairman John J. McCloy; Schroeder Bank attorneys Allen Dulles and his brother, John Foster Dulles; and Prescott Bush, a director of Union Banking Corporation and the Hamburg America shipping line. It is interesting to note that, following World War II, McCloy became the high commissioner of occupied Germany; John Foster Dulles became President Eisenhower’s secretary of state; Allen Dulles became the longest-serving CIA director; and Bush, as a senator from Connecticut, was instrumental in forming the CIA. It might also be noted that both McCloy and Allen Dulles sat on the largely discredited Warren Commission assigned by President Lyndon B. Johnson to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. After World War II, the globalist agenda was advanced by the creation of the United Nations. An earlier attempt to create a transnational organization, the League of Nations, failed because the U.S. Senate thought that ratification would end American sovereignty.
Nick Rockefeller, a participant in the World Economic Forum and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, may have revealed the agenda of the New World Order in a casual comment. According to the late Hollywood producer

Aaron Russo, Rockefeller told him, “The end goal is to get everybody chipped, to control the whole society, to have the bankers and the elite people control the world.”
Catherine Austin Fitts, assistant secretary of housing during the George H. W. Bush presidency, wrote in early 2009: “In the fall of 2001 I attended a private investment conference in London to give a paper, ‘The Myth of the Rule of Law or How the Money Works: The Destruction of Hamilton Securities Group.’ The presentation documented my experience with a Washington–Wall Street partnership that had engineered a fraudulent housing and debt bubble; illegally shifted vast amounts of capital out of the US; used ‘privatization’ as a form of piracy—a pretext to move government assets to private investors at below-market prices and then shift private liabilities back to government at no cost to the private liability holder. Other presenters at the conference included distinguished reporters covering privatization in Eastern Europe and Russia. As the portraits of British ancestors stared down upon us, we listened to story after story of global privatization throughout the 1990s in the Americas, Europe, and Asia.”
Fitts reiterated Rockefeller’s statement about a New World Order ruled by a global elite. She noted, “As the pieces fit together, we shared a horrifying epiphany: the banks, corporations and investors acting in each global region were the exact same players. They were a relatively small group that reappeared again and again in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Asia accompanied by the same wellknown accounting firms and law firms. Clearly, there was a

global financial coup d’etat underway.” Walter Cronkite, the legendary anchor of CBS News,
often referred to as “the most trusted man in America,” also stated his belief that the country was ruled by a small elite. Shortly before his death in July 2009, Cronkite was asked if there was a ruling class in America. “I am afraid there is,” he replied. “I don’t think it serves the democracy well, but that is true, I think there is. The ruling class is the rich who really command our industry, our commerce, our finance. And those people are able to so manipulate our democracy that they really control the democracy, I feel.”
With the bulk of the public both manipulated and distracted by political parties and the corporate mass media, no one seems capable of discerning, much less opposing, this New World Order of elitists with corporate, family, and class connections and common interests.
Until the real rulers of America are identified and confronted, no amount of hand-wringing, letter writing, or demonstrating can have any meaningful effect.
DISSENSION IN THE RANKS
THE FINANCIAL CALAMITY OF 2008 exposed the New World Order to be in slight disarray even before it was firmly established. Though the Obama administration is rife with men and women well connected to the centers of wealth and power, as will be seen, control over both the economic and social conditions in the United States

appeared to be getting out of their hands. There was even dissension in the ranks at the University of Chicago, which many consider to be the center of globalist thinking. The university’s 1995 Nobel Memorial Prize winner in Economic Sciences, Robert E. Lucas, claimed the Obama administration’s stimulus plans are “schlock economics,” while his colleague, Professor of Finance John H. Cochrane, stated they were based on discredited “fairy tales.” Their cry was reminiscent of the term “voodoo economics,” used by George H. W. Bush against Ronald Reagan’s free-enterprise plans during the Republican presidential primaries in 1980.
Paul Krugman, a New York Times op-ed columnist and winner of the 2008 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, wrote, “As I see it, the economics profession went astray because economists, as a group, mistook beauty, clad in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth. Until the Great Depression, most economists clung to a vision of capitalism as a perfect or nearly perfect system. That vision wasn’t sustainable in the face of mass unemployment, but as memories of the Depression faded, economists fell back in love with the old, idealized vision of an economy in which rational individuals interact in perfect markets, this time gussied up with fancy equations…the central cause of the profession’s failure was the desire for an all-encompassing, intellectually elegant approach that also gave economists a chance to show off their mathematical prowess.
“Unfortunately, this romanticized and sanitized vision of

the economy led most economists to ignore all the things that can go wrong. They turned a blind eye to the limitations of human rationality that often lead to bubbles and busts; to the problems of institutions that run amok; to the imperfections of markets—especially financial markets— that can cause the economy’s operating system to undergo sudden, unpredictable crashes; and to the dangers created when regulators don’t believe in regulation.”
Conspiracy theorists have long been ridiculed for their claims that the Great Depression was manufactured by globalist bankers. Krugman added much weight to that argument with a narrative involving a statement by the current chairman of the Fed’s board of governors, Ben Bernanke: “At a 90th birthday celebration for Milton Friedman, Ben Bernanke declared of the Great Depression: ‘You’re right. We did it. We’re very sorry. But thanks to you, it won’t happen again.’ The clear message was that all you need to avoid depressions is a smarter Fed.”
So we see that a plan is in play to debase the U.S. economy and impose a socialist system—whether Obama’s Marxist Socialism or Bush’s National Socialism apparently makes no difference to those wealthy or powerful enough to control the central bureaucracy of the state.
These globalists, who have manipulated world history for decades, if not centuries, are working a plan to turn the once-free and prosperous Republic of the United States into a socialist state populated by dumbed-down and

destitute zombies by draining dry the nation’s money supply.
It is truly a trillion-dollar conspiracy.

HOW TO CREATE ZOMBIES
All Socialism involves slavery. —HERBERT SPENCER, British Author, Economist,
and Philosopher, 1884

FREE PEOPLE CAN TRAVEL anywhere at any time they like. They can start a business or a new profession, or even take a vacation for as long as they wish. One sure way to create a slave is to ensure a person is indebted. After all, anyone who cannot do any of the things a free person can do because he or she has a mortgage, bills of all sorts, and the need for a monthly paycheck should be considered a slave of sorts—a debt slave.
POLITICAL HACKING
Government is not reason; it is not eloquent; it is force. Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
—GEORGE WASHINGTON
We shall consider politics the representative head of a zombie nation. Politics is a necessary partner in any widespread and high-level conspiracy. There is an inseparable blend of political and financial control in modern America. This powerful combination can be found

within the Federal Reserve System, in the corridors of Washington and Wall Street, and even in corporate news stories dealing with both politics and finance.
Americans do not need an economics degree to figure out that the nation is past bankruptcy. Using the most conservative estimates, there is more than $70 trillion of American debt compared with about $13 trillion in gross domestic production. This does not include the $300 trillion or more in toxic derivative debt.
FOREIGN TRADE AND BONDS
INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEFICITS HAVE been draining the nation’s reserves by $30 billion to $150 billion each year and have been for the past twenty years. Furthermore, our industrial, mining, and agricultural institutions have not only been weakened, but in many ways decimated by the movement toward globalization. No new steel foundries have been built in the United States since World War II.
The issue of debt is fundamental to understanding the machinations that formed the current economic crisis. By 2008, industry, banking, government, households, and individuals were smothered in debt. Eliminating debt will result in a society that looks far different from the one we have experienced in the past. The New York Times noted in a May 9, 2009, front-page report, “[T]he forces that enabled and even egged on consumers to save less and spend more—easy credit and skyrocketing asset values—

could be permanently altered by the financial crisis that spun the economy into recession.”
The “forces” mentioned in the Times article means bloated salaries, one of the few remaining options to corporations for cutting expenses and balancing the budget.
What is seen then is the culmination of a restructuring process that has taken place for more than two decades. Whereas the living standard has increased in many former dictatorships such as Russia and China, it has decreased in the United States thanks to these “forces,” controlled by the New World Order plutocrats.
Given the consistent transfer of money between nations, is it possible that the economic meltdown was not accidental? Some people claim the so-called bailout is nothing but the largest transfer of wealth in Western history, a panicked effort to shore up the U.S. dollar. Additionally, not only was the U.S. dollar in danger, but its bonds were too. Dollar-based Grand Net bonds’ net inflow dropped from an early 2007 high of about $950 billion to a 2009 low of nearly $200 billion, indicating a lack of faith in U.S. money. “The foreign creditors are moving away from the United States, plain and simple,” wrote statistical analyst Jim Willie.
Willie went on to say, “The US dollar stewards are NOT [original emphasis] demonstrating control, discipline, or even anything remotely resembling honesty or integrity…. If not for the US Fed buying most of the US Treasury [bonds] issued, the long-term interest rates would be rising rapidly

and with alarm [hyperinflation]…. They put the US dollar at grave risk. The Weimar territory lies directly ahead!…The Chinese financial market is actually leading the US market on directional turns. Sadly and tragically, the US dollar is stuck in mud, running out of time, awaiting a meat cleaver by foreign creditors.”
Both China, the world’s largest holder of foreigncurrency reserves, and Russia wield that cleaver; and both have called for a new global currency to replace the dollar as the dominant place to store reserves.
One little-known and also one of the most unsettling aspects of the 2008 financial tsunami was the 2009 report that China’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) might support large enterprises in defaulting on the derivatives contracts that they purchased in 2008 from international banks. The Chinese business had purchased the contracts to protect themselves from rising commodity prices, and if they default on these contracts, it would deal a serious blow to investment banks hoping to sell more derivative hedges in China, which is the world’s fastest-expanding major economy and top commodities consumer.
Another side to the problem is simply that any money China spends on bonds and derivatives is money they cannot loan to us. “[I]f China really wanted to spur domestic consumption, the best way to do so would be to stop buying our debt. Even better, they could sell Treasuries they already own and distribute the proceeds to their citizens to spend,” wrote Peter Schiff, author and president of Euro

Pacific Capital. “However, the Obama administration is heavily lobbying the Chinese to get them to step up to the plate and buy record amounts of new Treasury debt. Obama cannot have it both ways. He cannot claim he wants the Chinese to spend more, but then beg the Chinese government to take money away from Chinese consumers and loan it to the United States Treasury. In the end, Obama will get precisely what he publicly claims to desire but privately dreads. The Chinese government will come to its senses and stop buying Treasuries. This will cause the U.S. dollar to collapse, but it will also allow Chinese citizens to fully enjoy the fruits of their labor.”
Yet, as the Chinese people begin to buy more of their own products, it will mean fewer products available for export to America. And, as they spend more money on goods and services, there will be less money to loan to America. This could only lead to a deeper economic crisis.
The situation the United States finds itself in today is in many ways worse than that of the 1930s. More banks have failed than during the Great Depression, and unemployment is reaching levels of that time. But unlike the individuals of the 1930s—many of whom had come from an agricultural background and knew how to fend for themselves—the people in modern America can only look to government for their basic necessities. Could this push to government-regulated socialism be the real agenda behind the contrived financial meltdown of recent years?
The difference between today and the Great Depression is primarily about the worth of money. The 1930s

experienced a monetary depression. Money retained its value because it was simply hard to come by and prices were depressed to reflect its scarcity. Today, America is experiencing an inflationary depression. Prices continue to rise because of an inflated money supply. The more money that’s in circulation, the less it is worth.
LIARS’ LOANS
WILLIAM K. BLACK, a professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri School of Law in Kansas City, suggested that more than simple greed and incompetence brought about the economic crisis of 2008. In the 1980s, Black lead the prosecution against miscreants in the savings and loan scandal. According to Black, the mortgage debacle was centered on the creation of triple-Arated bonds that did not use verified incomes, assets, or employment. These were known as “liars’ loans.” Black pointed out that the liars’ loans were deceitful and fraudulent, and the banks involved knew it.
“Fraud is deceit. And the essence of fraud is, ‘I create trust in you, and then I betray that trust, and get you to give me something of value.’ And as a result, there’s no more effective acid against trust than fraud, especially fraud by top elites, and that’s what we have,” Black told PBS commentator Bill Moyers in April 2009. “The Bush Administration essentially got rid of regulation, so if nobody was looking, you were able to do this with impunity and

that’s exactly what happened. Where would you look? You’d look at the specialty lenders. The lenders that did almost all of their work in the sub-prime and what’s called Alt-A [risky Alternative A-paper loans], liars’ loans…. They knew that they were frauds.”
Black said liars’ loans were accomplished by failing to check the information provided by those seeking the loan. He said that often loan applicants were even told they could get a better deal if they inflated their income, job history, and assets. “We know that they said that to borrowers,” said Black.
He pointed out that IndyMac, the Federal Savings Bank that failed on July 11, 2008, specialized in liars’ loans—in 2006 it sold $80 billion worth of them—thus producing more losses than the entire savings and loan debacle of the 1980s.
And it was all based on fraud. Black explained, “Liars’ loans…were known to be extraordinarily bad. And now it was getting triple-A ratings. Now a triple-A rating is supposed to mean there is zero credit risk. So you take something that not only has crushing risk…and you create this fiction that it has zero risk. That itself…is a fraudulent exercise. And again, there was nobody looking during the Bush years…. When they finally did look, after the markets had completely collapsed, they found…the appearance of fraud in nearly every file….”
Black and others have compared the bad loans to the Ponzi scheme charged against Wall Street investment consultant Bernie Madoff. “Everybody was buying a pig in

the poke with a pretty pink ribbon, and the pink ribbon said, ‘Triple-A,’” said Black.
Although there is no specific law against liars’ loans, Black argued that the bankers involved knew they had been made under false representation and that they would never be repaid. The loans were based on deceit, which lies at the heart of the legal definition of criminal fraud. Why was no one prosecuted for these acts of fraud? According to Black, federal investigators did not begin to scrutinize the major lenders until the market had actually collapsed, despite early warnings.
“The FBI publicly warned, in September 2004, that there was an epidemic of mortgage fraud, that if it was allowed to continue it would produce a crisis at least as large as the Savings and Loan debacle,” said Black.
But the investigation didn’t happen. Due to the war on terrorism, the Bush Justice Department transferred five hundred white-collar specialists in the FBI to national terrorism and refused to replace them. Today, Black noted, “There are one-fifth as many FBI agents [detailed to investigating mortgage fraud] as worked the Savings and Loan crisis.”
GRAMM AND DEREGULATION
ONE OF THE PROTECTIONS against “banksters” (a derogatory term combining “bankers” with “gangsters”) was

the Glass-Steagall Act, which went into effect in 1934 following government hearings revealing how big banks of that day had looted customers for the benefit of a small group of insiders. The act separated normal banking activities (checking and savings accounts and commercial loans) from speculative investment banking (hedge funds, derivatives, and Wall Street investments) in the eyes of the law and allowed for regulation of the latter type of activity.
According to former U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairperson Brooksley Born, beginning in the Clinton years, almost all such protective regulation was stripped away. In a 2003 interview with Washington Lawyer, she stated, “One major issue was the enormous growth of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. OTC derivatives had been legally permitted for the first time in 1993 by a regulatory exemption that Wendy [Lee] Gramm had adopted as virtually her last act as CFTC chair. This allowed the growth of a business that is now estimated at over a hundred trillion dollars annually in terms of the notional value of contracts worldwide. Alan Greenspan had said that the growth of this market was the most significant development in the financial markets of the 1990s. The market was virtually unregulated and many, many times as big as the trading on the futures exchanges. The commission had kept some nominal authority over this market, but there were no mechanisms for enforcing the rules. For example, anti-fraud rules were retained, but no reporting was required. The market was completely opaque. Neither the commission nor any other federal

regulator knew what was going on in that market!” While Mrs. Gramm was chairing the CFTC, from 1988 to
1993, that body exempted Enron from regulation in trading of energy derivatives. Gramm later resigned from the CFTC and took a seat on the Enron board of directors where she served on its Audit Committee. Enron, the giant energy corporation whose bankruptcy in late 2001 was the largest in U.S. history to that date, drained more than $10 billion from shareholders and resulted in new regulations and legislation to enhance the reliability of financial reporting for public companies. Due to the massive fraud involved, several Enron executives, including founder Kenneth Lay and President Jeffrey Skilling, were sentenced to prison terms. The accounting firm of Arthur Andersen was found guilty of shredding Enron documents and eventually dissolved, putting eighty-five thousand persons out of work.
It should be noted that Wendy Lee Gramm is the wife of former Texas Republican senator Phil Gramm, who was forced to resign as senior economic adviser in John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign after describing Americans protesting the economic losses due to malfeasance as “a nation of whiners.” As a senator, Gramm was the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs during the Clinton administration, and he led efforts to pass banking deregulation laws such as the landmark Gramm-LeachBliley Act in 1999. The act removed Depression-era laws that prevented banks from engaging in insurance and

brokerage activities and was passed by an overwhelming majority of the House and by the Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President Clinton. Supporters of the bill used an old trick that was used to pass the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Like the Federal Reserve Act, the Gramm-Leach-Blilely Act was introduced on the last day before the Christmas holiday and was never debated by either congressional body. This bill, fully initiated by and supported by Republicans and passed with the support of Democrats during a Democratic administration, clearly demonstrates the collusion of the two political parties when it comes to corporate business.
Many economists claim the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act’s undermining of the Glass-Steagall Act was a significant cause of the 2007 sub-prime mortgage crisis and the 2008 global economic crisis. Economist Paul Krugman has described Phil Gramm as “the high priest of deregulation” and named Gramm and Fed chairman Alan Greenspan as the top two culprits responsible for the economic crisis. Gramm’s culpability was echoed by CNN, Time, and Britain’s the Guardian.
Brooksley Born described how, during the Clinton years, her commission questioned the bailout of large OTC derivatives dealers because they held $1.25 trillion worth of contracts yet held a mere $4 billion in supporting capital, which meant the dealers had far overextended themselves, leaving the market vulnerable to the very meltdown that occurred in 2008–09: “I became enormously concerned about OTC derivatives and thought the market was a

nightmare waiting to happen,” recalled Born. “I was particularly concerned that there was no transparency. No federal regulator knew what kind of position firms like LongTerm Capital Management and Enron had in the derivatives markets.” Warren Buffett later called OTC derivatives the financial weapons of mass destruction.
Born said the Fed and Congress rebuffed the CFTC’s efforts to reinstate some public protection over the financial field. “It wasn’t a regulatory effort. We were just asking questions! The concept release didn’t propose any rules. Alan Greenspan, Arthur Levitt, and Robert Rubin all said that these questions should not be asked and urged Congress to pass a bill that would forbid the commission from taking any regulatory steps on over-the-counter derivatives. There were no hearings on that bill, but during a congressional conference committee meeting on an appropriations bill, an amendment was added preventing the commission from taking any action on over-the-counter derivatives for six months. This occurred within a month after Long-Term Capital Management’s collapse!”
Professor William Black pointed to the experience with AIG (American International Group) as an example of how the lack of regulation led to obscene profits and market manipulation. The taxpayer-backed bailout of AIG in late 2008 ended up totaling more than $180 billion, a cost equaling the entire savings and loan scandal of the 1980s.
In September 2008, AIG’s credit ratings were downgraded and the Fed issued $85 billion in credit to keep the international insurance giant afloat. But the Fed

also took a stock warrant for nearly 80 percent of AIG’s equity. The government eventually increased AIG’s credit to as much as $182.5 billion. Public outrage ensued from news reports that AIG had retained millions of dollars in bailout money, some of it going for executive bonuses and lavish junkets. AIG bondholders and counterparties were paid at one hundred cents on the dollar by taxpayers, yet the taxpayers had no claim to future profits. In other words, the benefits of the bailout went to the AIG banks while the taxpayers suffered the costs.
“AIG made bad loans but with guarantees and charged big fees up front,” Black explained. “So, they booked a lot of income. Paid enormous bonuses…. And they got very, very rich. But, of course, then they had guaranteed this toxic waste…. [T]hose liars’ loans are going to have enormous losses. And so, you have to pay the guarantee on those enormous losses. And you go bankrupt. Except that you don’t in the modern world, because you’ve come to the United States, and the taxpayers play the fool. Under Secretary [of the Treasury Timothy] Geithner and Under Secretary [Henry] Paulson before him…took $5 billion…in U.S. taxpayer money and sent it to a huge Swiss Bank called UBS [through AIG]. [UBS] was defrauding the taxpayers of America. And we were bringing a criminal case against them. We eventually get them to pay a $780 million fine, but wait, we gave them $5 billion. So, the taxpayers of America paid the fine of a Swiss bank. And why are we bailing out somebody who is defrauding us?”
Some suggested that UBS was given $5 billion because

AIG was the largest contributor to Obama’s campaign and held much of the toxic derivative paper of Goldman Sachs, the major globalist investment firm once headed by Paulson. Though many Americans saw the AIG deal as simply a massive theft that debased our economy, no one in upper management—other than former figurehead and NASDAQ chairman Bernard L. “Bernie” Madoff—was ever charged with a crime.
According to TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) inspector Neil Barofsky, even by mid-October 2009, AIG executives still hadn’t repaid half of the $45 million they promised to return. But by March 2009, the public became enraged when it learned that AIG had paid at least $165 million in executive bonuses from the $180 billion in taxpayer loans to keep the company afloat. AIG chief executive officer Edward M. Liddy told a House committee hearing that he had asked employees to voluntarily give back at least half of their bonuses, although he admitted he had no authority to force them to do so.
In December 2008, the U.S. government also took hold of the financing arm of one of the nation’s largest manufacturers—General Motors. William Black and others have criticized the government takeover of General Motors (GM) as mere nationalization and have questioned why the president of GM was fired while the bankers who created the economic mess were not. “There are two reasons,” Black said. “One, [government officials are] much closer to the bankers. These are people from the banking industry. And they have a lot more sympathy. In fact, they’re outright

hostile to autoworkers, as you can see. They want to bash all of their contracts. But when they get to banking, they say, ‘contracts, sacred.’ But the other element of your question is we don’t want to change the bankers, because if we do, if we put honest people in, who didn’t cause the problem, their first job would be to find the scope of the problem. And that would destroy the cover-up.
“Geithner is…covering up. Just like Paulson did before him. Geithner is publicly saying that it’s going to take $2 trillion—a trillion is a thousand billion—$2 trillion taxpayer dollars to deal with this problem. But they’re allowing all the banks to report that they’re not only solvent, but fully capitalized. Both statements can’t be true. It can’t be that they need $2 trillion, because they have massive losses, and that they’re fine. These are all people who have failed. Paulson failed, Geithner failed. They were all promoted because they failed….”
Geithner denied any failure, claiming he was never supposed to regulate the banking business. During congressional testimony in March 2009, Geithner, who was the president of the New York Fed during much of the credit boom, indicated he had little interest in scrutinizing other banks’ activities. “I’ve never been a regulator, for better or for worse,” stated Geithner with surprising candor, adding, “And I think you’re right to say that we have to be very skeptical that regulation can solve all of these problems. We have parts of our system that are overwhelmed by regulation.”
“Overwhelmed by regulation!” lamented journalist Bill

Moyers over Geithner’s comments. “It wasn’t the absence of regulation that was the problem, it was despite the presence of regulation you’ve got huge risks that build up.” Black agreed, saying, “Well, he may be right that he never regulated, but his job was to regulate. That was his mission statement. As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, [he was] responsible for regulating most of the largest bank holding companies in America. And he’s completely wrong that we had too much regulation in some of these areas. I mean, he gives no details, obviously. But that’s just plain wrong.”
As 2009 drew onward, more financial institutions fell by the wayside, even as the media pumped out heartening stories of an economic rebound and more stimulus activity. In the face of criminal charges, the Alabama bank Colonial BancGroup, Inc., was closed by regulators in August 2009, becoming the seventy-seventh failed bank since the start of the year. It was also the largest bank failure since the loss of Washington Mutual, Inc., in 2008. Colonial posted a $606 million second-quarter loss in 2009, primarily due to loans to developers and home builders in Florida, a state where the housing industry tanked quickly. The bank failed to meet capital requirements to qualify for TARP funds because it simply did not have enough financial reserves to be eligible for TARP support.
One problem, said Robert Auerbach, formerly an economist with the Financial Services Committee of the

U.S. House of Representatives, is that central bank officials are often too close to the banks they are meant to keep in check. “The boards of directors of every Fed bank, including the New York Fed, have nine directors. Six of them are elected by the banks in the district,” said Auerbach. “So you have the banks in New York electing the directors that are supposed to supervise them.”
One proven means for keeping the true condition of some banks from the public eye during any reorganization is to retain the officers responsible for the problem in the first place. “[A]s long as I keep the old CEO who caused the problems, is he going to go vigorously around finding the problems? Finding the frauds?” asked Black in Moyers’s interview. He added, “We adopted a law after the Savings and Loan crisis, called the Prompt Corrective Action Law. And it requires [bank officers] to close these institutions. And they’re refusing to obey the law.”
When asked if Geithner and others in the Obama administration have engaged in a cover-up along with the banks, Black responded, “Absolutely, because they are scared to death…of a collapse. They’re afraid that if they admit the truth, that many of the large banks are insolvent. They think Americans are a bunch of cowards, and that we’ll run screaming to the exits. And we won’t rely on deposit insurance.”
DOWNSIZING AMERICA

PEOPLE LIKE BLACK AND Moyers who are in prestigious positions fail to mention that the motive behind Geithner’s and the banks’ financial antics can be traced to secretive globalist organizations such as the Council on Foreign Relations. Moyers also usually fails to mention that he is a member of the CFR, having obviously passed its stringent globalist eligibility requirements. It is in examples such as this that one can see the guiding hand of the globalists in both the world of commerce and of journalism.
Another person close to secretive society members was Henry “Hank” Paulson, the George W. Bush Treasury secretary who oversaw the bailout of AIG. During both the Bush and Obama administrations, AIG was used to funnel taxpayer funds to certain banks like UBS and Goldman Sachs, where Paulson had previously been the CEO.
In 2006, when Bush named Paulson to head the Treasury, the CFR explained the president’s agenda in an op-ed piece: “Bush essentially set five goals for the new Treasury secretary. Keep taxes low. Curb federal government spending to curb the budget deficit. Deal with international imbalances. Keep investment markets open. Support innovation and risk-taking in the private sector to boost US economic growth…. Paulson is the right man at the right time to take on issues like these.”
Despite the fact that IndyMac had failed only days before, on July 20, 2008, Paulson reassured the public that “it’s a safe banking system, a sound banking system. Our regulators are on top of it. This is a very manageable situation.”

Paulson has been identified as a key figure in the economic debacle that began in 2008. Time magazine stated, “If there is a face to this financial debacle, it is now his.”
Noting that Goldman Sachs got the lion’s share of taxpayer bailout money—$12.9 billion—William Black declared, “Now, in most stages in American history, that would be a scandal of such proportions that he wouldn’t be allowed in civilized society…. The tragedy of this crisis is it didn’t need to happen at all.”
Black, along with many other commentators, saw losses in workers’ income, securities, pensions, and futures as the result of the misconduct of “a relatively few, very well-heeled people, in very well-decorated corporate suites…and their ideologies, which swept away regulation.” Forbes magazine in 2006 estimated Paulson’s personal wealth at $700 million.
Black and others acknowledged that the destruction of the U.S. financial system came about due to a lack of integrity on the part of several high government and banking officials as well as massive conflicts of interest and a loss of morality. But this is simply the view of those unwilling to address the true issue—conspiracy.
After studying three separate government reports predicting a coming “fiscal doomsday,” the chairman of the investment counseling firm the Weiss Group Inc., Martin D. Weiss, had yet another word in mind. “When our leaders have no awareness of the disastrous consequences of their actions, they can claim ignorance and take no action. Or

when our leaders have no hard evidence as to what might happen in the future, they can at least claim uncertainty. But when they have full knowledge of an impending disaster… they have proof of its inevitability in ANY scenario…and they so declare in their official reports…but STILL don’t lift a finger to change course…then they have only one remaining claim: INSANITY!” he wrote (original emphasis). But it would be insane to actually believe that the nation’s money masters are truly insane. The only alternative is conspiracy. The financial meltdown happened because it was engineered to happen.
The belief that the economic collapse was orchestrated even reached the mainstream media. In early 2009, Washington insider Dick Morris pointed out to Fox News commentator Sean Hannity how the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was attempting to bring the U.S. economy under international control by using the excuse that it would merely be coordinating “regulatory efforts.” “The conspiracy theorists who have talked about the New World Order and the UN taking control, they are right…. It’s happening!” he exclaimed.
No matter how clearly Dick Morris saw things, only a few in Congress seemed to be getting the message. Texas Republican representative Kay Granger got it. In an August 2009 letter to constituents, she wrote, “Something happened this week that has serious consequences for each and every one of us, but you probably didn’t even know it happened. On Tuesday [August 25, 2009], the

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released their Midsession Review…. The Midsession Review showed that our country is going to be $2 trillion deeper in debt than the White House originally told us at the beginning of this year. That’s nearly $6,700 more debt for every man, woman, and child in America. If this doesn’t show that the policy of spend, spend, spend isn’t working, I don’t know what does.”
The only answer that Washington seems to come up with to deal with all problems is to spend more money on central government programs. Is this merely ineptitude or is this proof of a hidden agenda, one designed to force the American republic into a tightly controlled socialist society?
DEBT SLAVES
Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws.
—AN OFT-REPEATED PARAPHRASE OF AMSCHEL MAYER ROTHSCHILD’S 1838 QUOTE, “I
care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets. The man who controls Britain’s money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British
Money Supply.”

ECONOMICS IS THE LIFEBLOOD of any nation. Many compared President Barack H. Obama’s $787 billion economic stimulus package in 2009 to giving blood to a corpse. They feared the stimulus was simply throwing good money after bad, especially in light of health and datagathering provisions that seemed out of place in financial legislation.
As the U.S. economy deteriorated, President Obama expanded the Bush administration’s policies for bailing out banks and other financial institutions. President Obama explained that sending money directly to taxpayers might seem more appealing, but said it wouldn’t be as effective in stimulating the economy, saying that “A dollar of capital in a bank can actually result in eight or ten dollars of loans to families and businesses, a multiplier effect that can ultimately lead to a faster pace of economic growth.”
STIMULUS PACKAGE
OBAMA DID NOT COMMENT on criticism raised over the many improprieties connected to the economic crisis, nor did he comment on the argument that his “economic growth” actually was nothing other than an austerity budget based on war. Michel Chossudovsky, a professor of economics at the University of Ottawa and director of the Centre for Research on Globalization, noted that “[Obama’s] austerity measures hit all major federal spending programs with the exception of Defense and the

Middle East War, the Wall Street bank bailout, [and] Interest payments on a staggering public debt.
“At first sight, the budget proposal has all the appearances of an expansionary program, a demand oriented ‘Second New Deal’ geared towards creating employment, rebuilding shattered social programs and reviving the real economy. The realities are otherwise. Obama’s promise is based on a mammoth austerity program [original emphasis]. The entire fiscal structure is shattered, turned upside down.” Understandably, Chossudovsky concluded that the Obama plan “largely serves the interests of Wall Street, the defense contractors and the oil conglomerates.” He warned that the BushObama bank bailouts will lead America into a spiraling public debt crisis. “The economic and social dislocations are potentially devastating,” he added.
What this means is that the American taxpayer has been made the lender of last resort for the two governmentsponsored private enterprises—the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), whose combined debt of $5.4 trillion has been effectively transferred to the nation’s balance sheet. In addition to personal debt, every American now has a financial responsibility for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as other financial institutions.
What is even more maddening was the use of some bailout funds to create extravagant “golden parachute” retirement and severance payments to financial executives

who would have to leave their failing companies. These garnered unfavorable publicity in late 2008, as did the revelations of shady dealings between Wall Street and its regulators. Take, for instance, Charles Millard, former director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. (PBGC), an independent federal corporation that protects the pension plans of nearly forty-four million American workers and retirees. In May 2009, Millard was called to testify before the Senate Aging Committee over charges that he had cozy and improper contacts with Wall Street firms. Millard, citing his constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination, declined to answer questions. The PBGC, which insures corporate pensions, announced in late May 2009 that it had suffered a $33.5 billion deficit for the first half of the fiscal year, up considerably from a $10.7 billion deficit in 2008.
According to hearing testimony by PBGC inspector general Rebecca Anne Batts, Millard directly participated in granting more than $100 million in PBGC contracts to the international investment firms of Black-Rock Inc., JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs, against the advice of senior corporate management. Telephone and e-mail records showed Millard had contacts with his prospective bidders prior to hiring them to manage real estate and private equity investments. Millard’s experience illustrates both the incestuous relationship between persons in government who are supposed to be protecting the public and Wall Street. It is also noteworthy that Millard invoked the Fifth Amendment just like Mafia gangsters in the past. If there had been no wrongdoing, then why refuse to testify?

BEFORE THE CRASH
BEFORE THE MARKET CRASH in 2008, stress reached deep into certain strata of American life. Many retirees who once believed their money was safe saw principal losses of up to 80 or 90 percent of their investment.
Serious market slowdown began when investment banks across the globe refused to buy one another’s credit —an unusual move—and when mortgage-purchasing companies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae decided they could make more money by buying subprime mortgages. It was all part of the Bush administration’s policy of conforming to the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals, which were unveiled in 2000. These goals addressed such issues as the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, universal primary education, gender equality, health improvement, and ensuring environmental sustainability. It was laudable goals such as these that led to government pressure on lending institutions to issue subprime mortgages. The result? Hundreds of thousands of unsold homes.
Although it’s well known that the economic mess began with the banks, mortgage lenders, and real estate companies, the current housing and mortgage mess actually was the result of maneuvering by both Democrats and Republican politicians, a fact that adds considerable

weight to the argument that both major parties are controlled by the same globalists seeking to install a worldwide socialist system.
During the 1990s, Bill Clinton’s Democratic administration was pressuring Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest underwriter of home mortgages, to expand mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers. After all, granting low-income families the chance for home ownership sounded good on paper.
“Fannie Mae has expanded home ownership for millions of families in the 1990s by reducing down payment requirements,” Franklin D. Raines, chairman and CEO of Fannie Mae, told the New York Times in 1999. The newspaper noted that at least one study seemed to indicate racial prejudice in this lending as it reported that 18 percent of such subprime loans went to black borrowers as compared to 5 percent for all other groups. With great prescience, Times writer Steven A. Holmes noted in 1999, “In moving, even tentatively, into this new area of lending, Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times. But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.”
While Fannie Mae was lowering loan qualifications its stockholders were pressuring for greater profits, creating a recipe for financial disaster. And, as usual, both the political and financial machinations involved crossed party lines but

not the agenda of the globalists. Larry Summers—a Treasury secretary under Clinton,
Obama’s head of the National Economic Council, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations—is an advocate of cutting both corporate and capital gains taxes and convinced Clinton to sign into law several Republican bills that allowed banks to expand their powers. One of these bills repealed the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which prevented the merger of commercial banks, insurance companies, and brokerage firms such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. Additionally, Summers supported the Commodity Futures Modernization Act just before the 2000 election, which denied the governmental Commodity Futures Trading Corporation the ability to conduct oversight on the trading of financial derivatives. In the wake of Obama’s stimulus package in April 2009, Summers was criticized for collecting $2.7 million in speaking fees from Wall Street companies that had received government bailout money.
Summers was paving the way for the abuse of America’s financial system. Meanwhile, his protégé, Under Secretary for International Affairs Timothy Geithner, was making political gains. In 2002, during the first George W. Bush administration, Geithner left the Treasury Department to join the Council on Foreign Relations as a senior Fellow in the International Economics Department. Also a protégé of Henry Kissinger, Geithner had previously served as president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. By 2009, Geithner was Obama’s Treasury secretary. Again, here we

see two men (Summers and Geithner) connected to the same secretive globalist society—the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)—freely moving between both Democratic and Republican administrations. The CFR is secretive because it does not publicly announce its agenda or decisions, nor does it allow anyone to join without an invitation, and then only after careful vetting of the candidate’s propensity to favor globalization.
Princeton-educated economics researcher F. William Engdahl wrote that Treasury Secretary Geithner’s “dirty little secret” was that during the credit crisis, he only tried to save the five largest banks—banks that held “96 percent of all US bank derivative positions in terms of nominal value, and an eye-popping 81 percent of the total net credit risk exposure in event of default.” A derivative is a financial instrument whose worth is derived from another resource, whether property, goods, or services, called the underlying asset. Derivatives have been used in complex financial dealings to hedge against loss by allowing speculators to sell or trade the derivative and to gamble on gaining great profit by acquiring derivatives in the hope that the underlying asset will maintain or increase its value. In declining order, the five banks that had the most derivatives are JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank, Goldman Sachs, and the recently merged Wells Fargo– Wachovia. The leadership of these five banks is full of CFR members.

BANK STRESS TESTS
IN EARLY MAY 2009, after months of foot-dragging, federal regulators finally released the results of their bank “stress tests,” which test whether or not a certain bank can repay its debts and survive harsh economies. From the five banks listed above, only JP Morgan Chase passed the test. This means it was not required to raise more capital to prevent further losses.
The Charlotte-based Bank of America tested the worst on the stress tests. Government regulators informed the bank that it needed almost $34 billion in additional capital, which accounted for almost half of its total deficit. This news worsened problems for the banking giant, already under criticism for receiving more than $45 billion in government aid and for acquiring the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Bank of America wasn’t the only one with problems. Among others, Wells Fargo needed to raise $13.7 billion, GMAC Financial Services (formerly known as General Motors Acceptance Corporation) needed $11.5 billion, and Citigroup needed $5.5 billion. All told, the nation’s large banks needed $74.6 billion to build a capital cushion, according to federal regulators.
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke was publicly upbeat about the tests, describing them as a “fair and comprehensive effort.” “[Markets] can be reassured that banks will be strong and be able to lend even if the economy is worse than currently expected,” he told CNBC.

However, banks that failed the government’s stress test would be required to quickly come up with a plan to raise additional resources. One such plan was for the federal government to convert preferred shares bought by the U.S. Treasury into common stock. Douglas Elliott, a former JP Morgan Chase investment banker now with the Brookings Institution, told the Associated Press, “Essentially what we’ll be doing is swapping a kind of loan for actual ownership of a part of the bank. So it increases the taxpayers’ risk but also increases the potential return.”
Increased taxpayer risk? This does not seem such a good idea in shaky financial times. “Continuing to pour taxpayer money into these five banks without changing their operating system is tantamount to treating an alcoholic with unlimited free booze,” said F. William Engdahl. “The government bailout of AIG, at more than $180 billion [as of April 2009], has primarily gone to pay off AIG’s credit default swap obligations to counterpart gamblers Goldman Sachs, Citibank, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America, the banks who believe they are ‘too big to fail’. In effect, these institutions today believe they are so large that they can dictate the policy of the federal government. Some have called it a bankers’ coup d’etat. It is definitely not healthy.”
So the big banks pocket the money and the poor, strapped taxpayers are left with the bill, not to mention ownership of banks that continued to be troubled financially well into 2010.
By mid-2009, Americans were driving less and

spending less and the economy was deflating. Even though products became cheaper in the face of inflation, people stopped buying what they couldn’t afford. The housing market, which is a key indicator of economic strength, continued to lag far behind projections. Housing start-ups were doing particularly poorly. In April 2009, the U.S. Department of Housing and Development announced that non-government-backed housing starts, even after seasonal adjustments, were 54 percent lower (458,000) than the April 2008 rate of 1,001,000. Privately backed housing starts are any homes being built that are not being financed by the government. These have long been a prime indicator of the national economy.
There was also blame tossed at the unequal distribution of money. Chuck Collins, director of the Program on Inequality and the Common Good for the Institute for Policy Studies, said, “In our view, extreme inequalities contributed to the economic collapse…. This matters because wealth is power—the power to shape the culture, to distort elections, and shape government policy. A plutocracy is a ‘rule by wealth’—and more and more the priorities of the society are shaped by the interests of organized wealth.”
IMPROPRIETIES AND DEATH
APPARENTLY THE STRESS CREATED by the gargantuan amounts of money involved in the economic squeeze can be hazardous to your health as well as your

wealth. Stress may have contributed to the untimely deaths of at least five high-profile financial officers who died in the months following financial collapse in October 2008.
In January 2009, German billionaire Adolf Merckle apparently threw himself under a train after losing money shorting Volkswagen stock. Patrick Rocca, an Irish property speculator who was close to both President Bill Clinton and British prime minister Tony Blair, was found shot in the head following the crash of the real estate market. Chicago real estate mogul Steven Good was found fatally shot in his car. Financial adviser Rene-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet reportedly committed suicide in his Manhattan office just before Christmas 2008 after losing both his and his clients’ money in the Bernie Madoff scandal.
One particularly troubling death was that of Freddie Mac acting chief financial officer David Kellermann, who was found, the apparent victim of suicide, in his Vienna, Virginia, home on April 22, 2009. In 2008, the U.S. Treasury Department had to pump $45 billion into the government-sponsored mortgage firm to shore up $50 billion in losses. Questions immediately arose over reports about Kellermann’s role in the massive losses at Freddie Mac and about the nature of his death. One police spokesman told All Headline News that Kellermann died from a gunshot wound. Strangely enough, however, another police officer initially said he had hanged himself.
There was more controversy when reporters found that Kellermann was deeply involved in the Securities and

Exchange Commission’s and the U.S. Justice Department’s investigations into questionable bookkeeping practices within Freddie Mac. “Kellermann figured in several recent controversies at Freddie Mac,” reported the Washington Post in April 2009. “He and a group of company attorneys tussled with regulators in early March as the firm prepared to file its quarterly earnings report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. [Kellermann’s] group insisted that Freddie Mac inform shareholders of the cost to the company in helping carry out the Obama administration’s housing recovery plan. The regulators urged the company not to do so.”
“This isn’t the story of a guy who was trying to cover something up. It’s the story of a guy who was trying to do the right thing,” commented one housing industry veteran, who asked for anonymity, apparently suspecting the possibility of danger in telling the truth in such matters.
More than one conspiracy-minded researcher believed that something more than suicide was at work in Kellermann’s death and that there may have been other deaths connected to an effort to silence insiders who might have knowledge of the situation that someone does not want made public.
In a statement from his political action committee, perennial office seeker and conspiracy advocate Lyndon LaRouche said, “There is no evident motive for suicide in this case, but there is a motive for suppressing making Kellermann’s views known. The guy is killed, probably murdered. He deserves justice. His right to justice is

overriding. The question is what else did David Kellermann know which influential circles did not want him to reveal?”
THE RICH GET RICHER
IT HAS LONG BEEN said that the rich get richer while the poor get poorer. Many researchers equate the term “plutocracy”—rule by the wealthy—with the New World Order.
Although the belief that an organized plutocracy controls the world has long been derided as merely a “conspiracy theory,” G. William Domhoff, a professor in psychology and sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has the statistics to prove its existence. Domhoff’s first book, Who Rules America?, was a controversial 1960s bestseller that argued that the United States is dominated by an elite political and economic ownership class.
Using updated figures, Domhoff stated in a posting: “In the United States, wealth is highly concentrated in a relatively few hands. As of 2007, the top 1 percent of households (the upper class) owned 34.3 percent of all privately held wealth, and the next 19 percent (the managerial, professional, and small business stratum) had 50.3 percent, which means that just 20 percent of the people owned a remarkable 85 percent, leaving only 15 percent of the wealth for the bottom 80 percent (wage and salary workers). In terms of financial wealth (total net worth minus the value of one’s home), the top 1 percent of

households had an even greater share: 42.2 percent.” Domhoff defined “total assets” as the gross value of
owner-occupied housing plus other real estate owned by the household, cash and savings deposits, money market accounts, stocks and bonds, retirement plans, and other financial securities. He defined “total liabilities” as mortgage debt; consumer debt, including auto loans; and any other debt.
According to Domhoff, wealth distribution has been extremely concentrated throughout American history. During the nineteenth century, the top 1 percent of wealth owners owned 40 to 50 percent of assets in large port cities like Boston, New York, and Charleston. He said this disparity remained stable during the twentieth century, “although there were small declines in the aftermath of the New Deal and World War II, when most people were working and could save a little money. There were progressive income tax rates, too, which took some money from the rich to help with government services.
“Then there was a further decline, or flattening, in the 1970s, but this time in good part due to a fall in stock prices, meaning that the rich lost some of the value in their stocks,” wrote Domhoff. “By the late 1980s, however, the wealth distribution was almost as concentrated as it had been in 1929, when the top 1 percent had 44.2 percent of all wealth. It has continued to edge up since that time, with a slight decline from 1998 to 2004, before the economy crashed in the late 2000s and little people got pushed down again.”

Domhoff recorded that as of 2007, “income inequality in the United States was at an all-time high for the past 95 years, with the top 0.01 percent…receiving 6 percent of all U.S. wages, which is double what it was for that tiny slice in 2000; the top 10% received 49.7%, the highest since 1917.”
The numbers are even more shocking when viewed on a global scale. Using numbers from the World Institute for Development Economics Research, Domhoff concluded the top 10 percent of the world’s adults control about 85 percent of global household wealth. “That compares with a figure of 69.8 percent for the top 10 percent for the United States. The only industrialized democracy with a higher concentration of wealth in the top 10 percent than the United States is Switzerland at 71.3 percent,” he noted. At the same time, the U.S. government’s income is declining. According to the White House, 2008 individual income tax receipts were estimated at $1.168 trillion. Yet when tax receipts were tallied, the total was $155 billion less than that at $1.043 trillion.
Domhoff’s work presents a strong argument that wealth indeed equals power. Such power comes with the ability to donate to political parties, engage lobbyists, and provide grants to experts to think up new policies beneficial to the wealthy. Money also can hire public relations firms to improve one’s image or make large donations to universities and cultural entities such as museums, music halls, and art galleries. Wealth in the form of stock ownership can be used to control whole corporations,

which today have inordinate influence in society, media, and government.
And just as wealth can lead to power, so can power lead to wealth. Recent presidents such as Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon entered office without an extraordinary amount of money but left as millionaires. This is because those who control a government can use their positions to feather their own nests. Domhoff said this can be done by means of a favorable land deal for relatives at the local level or perhaps a huge federal government contract to a new corporation run by friends who will hire you when you leave government. “If we take a larger historical sweep and look cross-nationally, we are well aware that the leaders of conquering armies often grab enormous wealth, and that some religious leaders use their positions to acquire wealth,” commented Domhoff.
PUBLIC DEBT, PRIVATE PROFIT
WHETHER RICH OR POOR, most Americans believe their finances are safe, thanks to a federal government corporation created in the Great Depression year of 1933.
About eight-four hundred American banks participate in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), an independent agency created by the Congress to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation’s financial system by insuring deposits, supervising banks for safety

and soundness, and managing receiverships. These banks allocate a small portion of their profits to collectively insure bank deposits in cases where a bank fails.
And fail they did in late 2008 and 2009. Between the two years, 111 banks failed and many more teetered on collapse, effectively depleting the FDIC reserve fund from $52.8 billion in 2008 to a mere $10.4 billion in the first quarter of 2009, its lowest point since the height of the savings and loan scandal in 1992.
But what is more disturbing is that this reserve fund, much like Social Security, is merely an illusion.
In 2008, the former chairman of the FDIC, William M. Isaac, wrote an article titled “The Mythical FDIC Fund,” in which he revealed the FDIC’s insolvency: “When I became Chairman of the FDIC in 1981, the FDIC’s financial statement showed a balance at the U.S. Treasury of some $11 billion…. I decided it would be a real treat to see all of that money, so I placed a call to [then] Treasury Secretary Don Regan.”
The conversation went like this:
ISAAC: Don, I’d like to come over to look at the money.
REGAN: What money? ISAAC: You know…the $11 billion the FDIC has in the
vault at Treasury. REGAN: Uh, well you see, Bill, ah, that’s a bit of a
problem.

ISAAC: I know you’re busy. I don’t need to do it right away.
REGAN: Well…it’s not a question of timing…. I don’t know quite how to put this, but we don’t have the money.
ISAAC: Right…ha ha. REGAN: No, really. The banks have been paying
money to the FDIC, the FDIC has been turning the money over to the Treasury, and the Treasury has been spending it on missiles, school lunches, water projects, and the like. The money’s gone. ISAAC: But it says right here on this financial statement that we have over $11 billion at the Treasury. REGAN: In a sense, you do. You see, we owe that money to the FDIC, and we pay interest on it. ISAAC: I know this might sound pretty far-fetched, but what would happen if we should need a few billion to handle a bank failure? REGAN: That’s easy—we’d go right out and borrow it. You’d have the money in no time…same day service most days. ISAAC: Let me see if I’ve got this straight. The money the banks thought they were storing up for the past half century—sort of saving it for a rainy day—is gone. If a storm begins brewing and we need the money, Treasury will have to borrow it. Is that about it? REGAN: Yep.

ISAAC: Just one more thing, while I’ve got you. Why do we bother pretending there’s a fund?
REGAN: I’m sorry, Bill, but the President’s on the other line. I’ll have to get back to you on that.
There is no record that Regan ever got back to Isaac. “Why do we bother pretending there’s a fund?” asked Darryl Robert Schoon, economic commentator and author of How to Survive the Crisis and Prosper in the Process. “[T]he answer is obvious. Modern economics, i.e. central banking, is a shell game where bankers with the aid of governments have foisted a highly lucrative fraud on society; and, while the fraud of the FDIC fund is egregious, it is no more egregious than the fraud of the Fed or of the economy itself.”
And the fraud does not stop with the FDIC. Schoon and others believe modern banking is essentially a Ponzi scheme on a global scale, in which bankers loan nonexistent money and receive repayment of the nonexistent funds plus compounding interest in return.
“In economies based on the fraudulent issuance of money as debt, there are only predators and victims. Bankers are the predators, society is the victim (businessmen are victims who often believe they’re predators) and governments are the well-paid-off referees in the rigged game being played out in today’s capital markets,” Schoon wrote.
At the heart of this combination Ponzi scheme and shell

game lies the privately owned Federal Reserve System. But you and I, dear reader, will get to that.
Chris Martenson, a businessman with a doctorate in neurotoxicology from Duke University and an MBA in finance from Cornell, wrote, “Our entire monetary system, and by extension our economy, is a Ponzi economy in the sense that it really only operates well when in expansion mode. Even a slight regression triggers massive panics and disruptions that seem wholly inconsistent with the relative change, unless one understands that expansion is more or less a requirement of our type of monetary and economic system. Without expansion, the system first labors and then destroys wealth far out of proportion to the decline itself. What fuels expansion in a debt-based money system? Why, new debt (or credit), of course! So one of the things we keep a very close eye on, as they do at the Federal Reserve, is the rate of debt creation.”
Martenson and others believe a major theme in the current credit bubble collapse is the extent to which private credit has been crumbling while the Federal Reserve has been purchasing debt and the federal government has been increasing its borrowing. “In essence, public debt purchases and new borrowing has attempted to plug the gap left by a shortfall in private debt purchases and borrowing [original emphasis]. That’s the scheme right now —the Federal Reserve is creating new money out of thin air to buy debt, while the US government is creating new debt at the most fantastic pace ever seen. The attempt here is to keep aggregate debt growing fast enough to prevent the

system from completely seizing up,” explained Martenson. Martenson, who said he continually seeks to accept or
reject his own hypotheses based on the evidence at hand, explained that the Federal Reserve has been monetizing far more U.S. government debt than has openly been revealed by allowing foreign central banks to swap their agency debt for Treasury debt. “This is not a sign of strength and reveals a pattern of trading temporary relief for future difficulties,” Martenson wrote. “When the full scope of this program is more widely recognized, more pressure will fall upon the dollar, as more and more private investors shun the dollar and all dollar-denominated instruments as stores of value and wealth. This will further burden the efforts of the various central banks around the world as they endeavor to meet the vast borrowing desires of the US government. One possible result of the abandonment of these efforts is a wholesale flight out of the dollar and into other assets. To US residents, this will be experienced as rapidly rising import costs and increasing costs for all internationally-traded basic commodities, especially food items. For the rest of the world, the results will range from discomforting to disastrous, depending on their degree of dollar linkage…. The shell game that the Fed is currently playing does not change the basic equation: Money is being printed out of thin air so that it can be used to buy US government debt.” It has been long understood that creating more money leads to inflation since the more currency in circulation, the less it’s worth, especially paper money that has no intrinsic value.

As to the government buying private debt, a crude example of what has happened goes like this:
Tom has a mortgage on a very nice house. He has a good job and his credit is good. Dick lives in a run-down home badly in need of serious repairs and has been in and out of jobs so he has a low credit score. Yet, due to government pressure on the lending industry to provide housing to all, Dick has a mortgage on his home. Through a scheme called “bundling,” Tom’s mortgage and a few others like his are combined with Dick’s mortgage and many others like his. By sleight of hand, this combined package of mortgages is given an A-1 rating and the package is sold to venture capital firms as a good investment. With these investment packages growing in number, the economy booms. But when the housing bubble breaks, the investment firms, many of the largest filled with globalists, turn to the government for relief with the argument that if they go bankrupt, the whole national economy will suffer. The government then pays these firms for their investment at full value, even though many of the houses are sub-standard (subprime) and not worth full value. The government pays with taxpayer money, then orders more money printed to cover the shortfall. The investment firms are also paid with the condition that their money comes in the form of government bonds, which means even more paper is spread around, causing further inflation and devaluation. It is robbery on a grand scale, with the strapped taxpayer taking the hit while the middlemen financiers continue to make a profit. To add insult to injury,

many of these financiers are banks and investment houses outside the United States, which means U.S. taxpayers are paying back foreign investors for making bad investments.
HOW IT ALL BEGAN
OUR NATION’S ECONOMIC DECAY did not start with the Obama administration or even with the George W. Bush regime; rather, it began decades earlier in the early twentieth century with the founding of a privately owned banking syndicate known as the Federal Reserve System, a government-sanctioned cartel of private banks that was created in a conspiratorial manner and is under heavy criticism to this day, even being blamed for the current financial woes.
Joan Veon, a businesswoman and international reporter who has covered more than a hundred global conferences on financial and trade matters, wrote that the recent bailouts were simply the latest moves by the globalists to solidify their control over the United States. “The bailout of Freddie and Fannie provided us with the latest excitement in the diabolical saga of the raping, robbing, and pillaging of America. Interestingly enough, it took place 13 months after the beginning of the credit crunch…it was planned and managed destruction in order to accomplish the final transfer of America’s financial sovereignty,” she noted.
Former secretary of housing Catherine Austin Fitts

agreed, stating that in the attempt to build a global American-run military empire, trillions of dollars have been shifted out of the United States by both legal and illegal means to reinvest in Asia and emerging markets through taxpayer bailout money coupled with Fed loans to foreign banks. In doing so, she said we have left economic sovereignty behind. “Finally, the expense and corruption of empire resulted in bailouts of $12–14 trillion, delivering a new financial war chest to the people leading the financial engineering [the globalists]. Now we have exploding unemployment, an exploding federal deficit, an Inspector General for the TARP [Troubled Asset Relief Program] bailout program predicting that the ultimate bailout cost could rise to $23.7 trillion…,” said Fitts.
With this lost money came lost jobs. Unemployment figures are usually a good gauge of the nation’s economy. In mid-2009, unemployment was officially 9.4 percent. If for some reason this number seems low, one must note that that these numbers do not include “those who would like a job but have stopped looking—so-called discouraged workers—and those who are working fewer hours than they want,” said Dennis Lockhart, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta. With these numbers included, the unemployment rate would move from the official 9.4 percent to 16 percent. As 2010 progressed, so did the unemployment figures, which began to match the numbers of the Great Depression.
Yet unlike the 1930s, money was still available; and money is the lifeblood of a zombie nation. The trappings of

wealth and bankers’ lifestyles are often admired by outsiders with a fervency bordering on religious, yet only those who live these lifestyles understand the inner workings of the money cult. And they work hard to keep these inner workings secret.
Consider the 1966 essay “Gold and Economic Freedom” by Alan Greenspan, who from 1987 to 2006 was chairman of the Fed. Greenspan wrote, “Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the ‘hidden’ confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights. If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding the statists’ antagonism toward the gold standard.” In other words, spending paper money you don’t have runs up debt that, with interest due, earns much more than the original debt, especially if it is not repaid promptly. This is the “hidden confiscation of wealth.” Paper money can be devalued, but a gold piece will always retain some value and is therefore a good hedge against both inflation and devaluation, which is why the globalists seeking a strong central authority (statists) are generally opposed to a gold standard, because it robs them of the means of robbing the public through high interest rates, service charges, late payments, and monetary exchanges.
Following a talk by Greenspan at the Economic Club of New York in 1993, Dr. Lawrence Parks, the executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Monetary Education (FAME), approached the Fed chairman and asked if he still agreed with his 1966 conclusions on deficit

spending and gold. “Absolutely,” Greenspan responded. Parks then asked why Greenspan did not speak out about his knowledge and the response was, “Some of my colleagues at the institution I represent [the Fed] do not agree with me.”
Whether Greenspan was fibbing or he was mistaken about his colleagues, the Fed actually shared Greenspan’s opinion on gold—they just didn’t want the public to know. The nonprofit Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee Inc. (GATA) was organized in 1999 to oppose the illegal collusion over the price and supply of gold and related financial securities. According to the committee, in 2009, the Federal Reserve System disclosed to Congress that it had made gold swap arrangements with foreign banks, but it does not want the public to know about them. This disclosure directly contradicted the Fed’s earlier denials of making gold swaps to GATA back in 2001. A GATA news release also suggested that the Fed was indeed very much involved in the surreptitious international central bank manipulation of the gold price particularly and the currency markets generally,
Earlier in 2009, GATA sought information on current gold swaps, a practice denied by Alan Greenspan, then Fed chairman, back in 1995. But this question was rebuffed by the Fed, which claimed this information was exempt from Freedom of Information Act requests. GATA appealed to the Fed’s board. But in a September 2009 letter to GATA’s lawyer, Federal Reserve Board member Kevin M. Warsh upheld the denial of information by stating,

“In connection with your appeal, I have confirmed that the information withheld under Exemption 4 consists of confidential commercial or financial information relating to the operations of the Federal Reserve Banks that was obtained within the meaning of Exemption 4. This includes information relating to swap arrangements with foreign banks on behalf of the Federal Reserve System and is not the type of information that is customarily disclosed to the public. This information was properly withheld from you.”
GATA claimed the letter was not the first admission of the Fed making gold swaps but that “it comes at a sensitive time in the currency and gold markets.” According to a GATA news release, “The U.S. dollar is showing unprecedented weakness, the gold price is showing unprecedented strength, Western European central banks appear to be withdrawing from gold sales and leasing, and the International Monetary Fund is being pressed to take the lead in the gold price suppression scheme by selling gold from its own supposed reserves in the guise of providing financial support for poor nations.”
It is now expected that a lawsuit will be filed in federal court to appeal the Fed’s denial of GATA’s freedom-ofinformation request concerning gold swaps. Those people stocking up on gold for safekeeping might keep in mind that gold and silver—in fact, just about anything considered a financial asset—may be seized by federal authorities in wartime or any officially declared “emergency.” Those who hoard gold against the possible devaluation or collapse of the dollar might remember that during the Great

Depression, the hoarding and use of gold as a medium of exchange was outlawed.
According to the GATA website, government confiscation of gold has never been a serious or imminent threat, but in any “emergency,” this could swiftly change. “While the U.S. Government in 1933 did demand the exchange of circulating government-issued coins for paper money (proceeding to devalue the paper money after the gold was surrendered), that gold then was a huge part of the country’s money supply, and amid the national economic collapse at that time the government could make a plausible complaint against ‘hoarding.’ There are no such circumstances today, gold no longer being in general circulation as currency…. But of course lately the arrogance and imperiousness of the U.S. government have far exceeded even the paranoia of precious metals investors. Certainly capital controls may be imposed in the United States in the next currency crisis, and it’s not far from capital controls to even more brutal interventions in the economy.”
Such concern intensified with a 2005 letter to GATA in which the former chief counsel for the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, Sean M. Thornton, explained the scope of the government’s power in making financial seizures. “It took GATA six months and a little prodding to get answers from the Treasury, but the Treasury’s reply, when it came, was remarkably comprehensive and candid.
“The government’s authority to interfere with the

ownership of gold, silver, and mining shares arises…from the Trading with the Enemy Act, which became law in 1917 during World War I and applies during declared wars, and from 1977’s International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which can be applied without declared wars.
“While the Trading with the Enemy Act authorizes the government to interfere with the ownership of gold and silver particularly, it also applies to all forms of currency and all securities. So the Treasury official stressed that it could be applied not just to shares of gold and silver mining companies but to the shares of all companies in which there is a foreign ownership interest. Further, there is no requirement in the law that the targets of the government’s interference must have some connection to the declared enemies of the United States, or, really, some connection to foreign ownership. Anything that can be construed as a financial instrument, no matter how innocently it has been used, is subject to seizure under the Trading with the Enemy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.”
USURY
“USURY” IS A TERM that has all but disappeared from our language. Once, “usury” was defined as any interest charged for a loan, but modern dictionaries softened this definition to merely “excessive” interest. The Texas Constitution once defined “usury” as any interest in excess

of 6 percent. This ceiling was increased over the years until the whole concept was deleted.
Those who know the Bible recall that Jesus was crucified by those in power for chasing “money changers” out of the temple. Public anger today is being directed at the financial moguls of both Wall Street and Washington, D.C.
“Charging interest on pretended loans is usury, and that has become institutionalized under the Federal Reserve System,” argued G. Edward Griffin, author of The Creature from Jekyll Island. This has been accomplished by masking the operations of the Fed in secrecy and arcane economic terms. “The…mechanism by which the Fed converts debt into money may seem complicated at first, but it is simple if one remembers that the process is not intended to be logical but to confuse and deceive,” Griffin added.
Former Washington Post editor William Greider wrote, “The details of [the Fed’s] actions were presumed to be too esoteric for ordinary citizens to understand.” Some believe this ignorance may be a blessing. Henry Ford was quoted as saying, “It is well enough that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system for, if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.”
“Most Americans have no real understanding of the operation of the international moneylenders,” stated the late senator Barry Goldwater.

“The bankers want it that way. We recognize in a hazy sort of way that the Rothschilds and the Warburgs of Europe and the houses of J. P. Morgan, Kuhn, Loeb and Company, Schiff, Lehman and Rockefeller possess and control vast wealth. How they acquire this vast financial power and employ it is a mystery to most of us. International bankers make money by extending credit to governments. The greater the debt of the political state, the larger the interest returned to the lenders. The national banks of Europe are actually owned and controlled by private interests.” These same “private interests” now own and control the Federal Reserve System.
MONEY FOR FAITH AND DEBT
ACCORDING TO WILLIAM GREIDER, the Fed has assumed a cult-like power: “To modern minds, it seemed bizarre to think of the Federal Reserve as a religious institution…. Yet the conspiracy theorists, in their own demented way, were on to something real and significant…. [The Fed] did also function in the realm of religion. Its mysterious powers of money creation, inherited from priestly forebears, shielded a complex bundle of social and psychological meanings. With its own form of secret incantation, the Federal Reserve presided over awesome social ritual, transactions so powerful and frightening they seemed to lie beyond common understanding….

“Above all, money was a function of faith. It required implicit and universal social consent that was indeed mysterious. To create money and use it, each one must believe and everyone must believe. Only then did worthless pieces of paper take on value.”
Money today is increasingly mere electronic blips in a computer accessed by plastic cards at ATMs. There is nothing to back it up. As money is loaned at interest by great institutions, its worth decreases as more and more of it comes into existence. This is called inflation, which in some ways is a built-in tax on the use of money. And inflation can be manipulated upward or downward by those who control the flow of money, whether it be through paper or the electronic blips.
“The result of this whole system is massive debt at every level of society today,” wrote author William Bramley. “The banks are in debt to the depositors, and the depositors’ money is loaned out and creates indebtedness to the banks. Making this system even more akin to something out of a maniac’s delirium is the fact that banks, like other lenders, often have the right to seize physical property if its paper money is not repaid.”
THE FEDERAL RESERVE ANOMALY
IN AMERICA, THE BANKERS of the Federal Reserve System have the greatest control of the nation’s money. Because the Fed is at the center of U.S. monetary policy

control, it has become the central bank of the United States. By changing the supply of money in circulation, the Fed influences interest rates, which in turn affects millions of families’ mortgage payments. It also can cause financial markets to boom or collapse and the economy to expand or contract into recession.
The Fed is “the crucial anomaly at the very core of representative democracy, an uncomfortable contradiction with the civic mythology of self-government,” wrote William Greider. His 1987 book Secrets of the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country disparages “nativist conspiracy theories” yet presents an eloquent conspiracy argument for the Fed’s control.
Consider that a paper bill is simply a promissory note to be traded at some point for something of value. It thus makes sense to perceive paper money as valuable as real goods or services. This viewpoint worked well before the invention of interest. The early goldsmiths in Europe who warehoused gold coins used their stockpiles as the basis for issuing paper money. Since it was highly unlikely that everyone would demand their gold back at the same time, the smiths became bankers, loaning out a portion of their stockpile at interest for profit. This practice—loaning the greater portion of wealth while retaining only a small fraction for emergencies—became known as fractional reserve, or fractional banking. This system worked well until everyone suddenly wanted their deposits back and started a “run” on the bank. Bank runs, or depositors demanding

their money back all at one time, were a major cause of financial damage during the Great Depression of the 1930s. But runs are not just history. In early 2008, Northern Rock Bank, the fifth-largest bank in the United Kingdom, was nationalized by the government due to financial problems created by the subprime mortgage crisis and a run on its branch banks.
After the invention of fractional banking came the implementation of “fiat” money—intrinsically worthless paper money made valuable by law or decree of government. An early example of this system was recorded by Marco Polo during his visit to China in 1275. Polo noted the emperor forced his people to accept black pieces of paper with an official seal on them as legal money under pain of imprisonment or death. The emperor then used this fiat money to pay all his foreign debts.
“One is tempted to marvel at the [emperor’s] audacious power and the subservience of his subjects who endured such an outrage,” wrote G. Edward Griffin, “but our smugness rapidly vanishes when we consider the similarity of our own Federal Reserve Notes. They are adorned with signatures and seals; counterfeiters are severely punished; the government pays its expenses with them; the population is forced to accept them; they—and the ‘invisible’ checkbook money into which they can be converted—are made in such vast quantity that it must be equal in amount to all the treasures of the world. And yet they cost nothing to make. In truth, our present monetary system is an almost exact replica of that which supported the warlords of seven

centuries ago.” Nowhere was the art of making money out of money
more developed than in the ancient Khazar Empire, which evolved from nomadic raider-clans operating on the eastwest caravan routes in the Caucasus Mountain region north of Iraq and between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. By the tenth century, the Khazars had created a wealthy empire that stretched from north of the Black Sea to the Ural Mountains and west of the Caspian Sea to the Dnieper River.
The warlords of the Khazars thought that exchanging and loaning money would be more profitable and less hazardous than raiding caravans. There was one problem. The Khazar Empire was almost evenly divided among Christians, Muslims, and Jews. Both Christians and Muslims believed that charging interest on a loan, then called usury, was a sin. Only Jews could openly charge interest on loans. Whether they did it out of pragmatism or actual religiosity, the Khazar aristocrats professed a conversion to Judaism. According to the Random House Encyclopedia, “Some scholars believe they [the Khazars] are the progenitors of many Eastern European Jews.” This would include the renowned Rothschild family, who financially ruled Europe for more than a century. Conspiracy researchers claim they still dominate the world financial order and have been the financial backers of the Rockefellers and other wealthy families. It might be noted that none of these converted Khazarians had any connection whatsoever to Palestine, yet these were among

the Russian progenitors of the political movement known as Zionism.
The 1917 Balfour Declaration, a statement by British foreign secretary Alfred Balfour that guaranteed a Jewish home in Palestine and was later approved as a mandate by the League of Nations, is acknowledged as the foundation for the creation of the state of Israel. This letter originally was a reply to a leading Zionist, Baron Walter Rothschild, the first unconverted Jewish peer in England’s House of Lords.
The money-management methods of the Rothschild banking dynasty have been emulated for decades by the globalist financiers, whether Jewish or otherwise. One key component of this management is secrecy. Utilizing bought-off politicians, who catch the public rage and scrutiny, major globalists are able to operate out of the public eye almost with impunity. Derek Wilson, who chronicled the Rothschild empire in his 1988 book Rothschild: The Wealth and Power of a Dynasty, wrote, “Even when, in later years, some of them [Rothschilds] entered parliament, they did not feature prominently in the assembly chambers of London, Paris or Berlin. Yet all the while they were helping to shape the major events of the day: by granting or withholding funds; by providing statesmen with an official diplomatic service; by influencing appointments to high office; and by an almost daily intercourse with the great decision makers.”
The invention of the printing press, which allowed for the printing of paper money as well as the Bible, led to the Age

of Enlightenment and the decline of the Roman Church. Money replaced religion as the new control mechanism of the wealthy elite. And despite the popular myth, the American colonial revolt against England occurred more over concern for its own currency than a small tax on tea. Benjamin Franklin wrote, “…the inability of the colonists to get the power to issue their own money permanently out of the hands of George III and the international bankers was the prime reason for the Revolutionary War.” As previously discussed, wealth equals power. And the American revolutionists knew that to gain true freedom, they had to break the power of the Rothschild-dominated Bank of England, which had outlawed their money—colonial script.
Once America’s freedom was secured, Founding Fathers Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton began arguing over whether or not to adopt a central bank. Hamilton believed in a strong central government with a central bank overseen by a wealthy elite. “No society could succeed which did not unite the interest and credit of rich individuals with those of the state,” Hamilton wrote. Supporters of Hamilton’s elitism formed America’s first political party, the Federalists. Hamilton, once described as a “tool of the international bankers,” argued that “A national debt, if it is not excessive, will be to us a national blessing. It will be a powerful cement to our nation. It will also create a necessity for keeping up taxation to a degree which, without being oppressive, will be a spur to industry.”
America’s first central bank, the Bank of North America, was created in 1781 by Continental congressman Robert

Morris, who modeled the bank after the Bank of England. The bank was formed before the Constitution was drafted and was wrought with fraud and plagued by inflation caused by the creation of baseless “fiat” currency. The bank lasted for three years. Morris’s former aide, Alexander Hamilton, became secretary of the Treasury and in 1791 headed the next attempt at a central bank by establishing the First Bank of the United States. He was strongly opposed by Jefferson and his followers. In 1811, the charter of the First Bank of the United States was not renewed.
Jefferson knew from British and European history that a central bank trading on interest could quickly become the master of a nation, noting to John Taylor in 1816 that “…the other nations of Europe have tried and trodden every path of force or folly in fruitless quest of the same object, yet we still expect to find in juggling tricks and banking dreams, that money can be made out of nothing…. [B]anking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale.” Jefferson added, “Already they have raised up a money aristocracy…. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.”
Jefferson believed that instituting a central bank would be unconstitutional. “I consider the foundation of the Constitution as laid on this ground [enshrined in the Tenth Amendment]: That ‘all powers not delegated to the United States, by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the
