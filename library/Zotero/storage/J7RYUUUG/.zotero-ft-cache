So, there's 11s-12s of "interactive cost".

I'm not sure what those 11s-12s come from, but I think it's safe to take
the "1.9x" as the more relevant measure in terms of measuring the impact
of native compilation on the speed of bytecomp.el.

I agree it's a bit surprising.  Even it was running in a "large"
interactive session, it could also be due to the time it takes to GC
a larger heap (tho we normally GC such larger heaps proportionally less
often, so that doesn't really explain it either).

But since this is orthogonal to the gccemacs native compilation, maybe
we should move it to a bug report where we can try and investigate it.
