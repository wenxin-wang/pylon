* Credentials

If I want to write to this repo at a different (somewhat) trusted place,
I need write-access to it. Since I do not really understand how to use
yubikey & gpg, I hestitate to use them, especially where I think that
the repo do not have much value to whoever has access to.

So I prefer git credentials with https connection.

** Plaintext store

Generate the git config, see [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage]]
for the input format.

#+begin_src bash
  git credential-store --file ~/some_file store
#+end_src

Add the following lines to my git config

#+begin_quote
  [credential]
    helper = store --file ~/some_file
#+end_quote
